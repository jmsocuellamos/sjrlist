Although, various machine learning (ML) based disease classification techniques were developed, they face severe issues. Hence, a novel optimized framework named as Wolf based Generative Adversarial System (WbGAS) system was designed to predict and specify the heart disease using Electrocardiogram (ECG) database. The collected dataset contains three classes namely Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR), Arrhythmia (ARR), and Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). The dataset is initialized and trained using the proposed (WbGAS) approach to predict the normal and abnormal signals present in dataset. In addition, the integration of wolf fitness function in the presented approach provides finest prediction rate. Moreover, the type of heart disease is specified based on the trained features. Also, a case study was presented with three different cases to explain the functioning of designed (WbGAS) approach. The designed model is implemented in MATLAB software and then, the performance of the system is determined as specificity, recall, accuracy, and precision value. At the end, to verify the results of the developed technique a comparative assessment was performed by comparing the outcomes of presented approach with existing ML based approaches. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.;Arrhythmia--Generative adversarial network--Grey wolf algorithm--Heart disease classification--Heart failure;Cardiology--Diseases--Electrocardiograms--Forecasting--Generative adversarial networks--Heart--Adversarial system--Arrhythmia--Disease classification--Gray wolf algorithm--Gray wolves--Heart disease--Heart disease classification--Heart failure--Machine-learning--Systems approach--MATLAB;Springer;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85172764256

Cuza, 13, Craiova, 200585, Romania;Background: Congenital Heart Disease represents the most frequent fetal malformation. The lack of prenatal identification of congenital heart defects can have adverse consequences for the neonate, while a correct prenatal diagnosis of specific cardiac anomalies improves neonatal care neurologic and surgery outcomes. Sonographers perform prenatal diagnosis manually during the first or second-trimester scan, but the reported detection rates are low. This project’s primary objective is to develop an Intelligent Decision Support System that uses two-dimensional video files of cardiac sweeps obtained during the standard first-trimester fetal echocardiography (FE) to signal the presence/absence of previously learned key features. Methods: The cross-sectional study will be divided into a training part of the machine learning approaches and the testing phase on previously unseen frames and eventually on actual video scans. Pregnant women in their 12–13 + 6 weeks of gestation admitted for routine first-trimester anomaly scan will be consecutively included in a two-year study, depending on the availability of the experienced sonographers in early fetal cardiac imaging involved in this research. The Data Science / IT department (DSIT) will process the key planes identified by the sonographers in the two- dimensional heart cine loop sweeps: four-chamber view, left and right ventricular outflow tracts, three vessels, and trachea view. The frames will be grouped into the classes representing the plane views, and then different state-of-the- art deep-learning (DL) pre-trained algorithms will be tested on the data set. The sonographers will validate all the intermediary findings at the frame level and the meaningfulness of the video labeling. Discussion: FE is feasible and efficient during the first trimester. Still, the continuous training process is impaired by the lack of specialists or their limited availability. Therefore, in our study design, the sonographer benefits from a second opinion provided by the developed software, which may be very helpful, especially if a more experienced colleague is unavailable. In addition, the software may be implemented on the ultrasound device so that the process could take place during the live examination.

Obstructive sleep apnea is strongly associated with the risk of developing several heart diseases, including coronary heart disease, heart attack, heart failure, and stroke. In addition, obstructive sleep apnea increases the risk of developing irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias), which can lead to low blood pressure. To prevent these conditions, this study presents a novel machine-learning (ML) model for predicting sleep apnea based on electronic health data that provides accurate predictions and helps in identifying the risk factors that contribute to the development of sleep apnea. The dataset used in the study includes 75 features and 10,765 samples from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care (SNAC). The proposed model is based on two modules: the XGBoost module assesses the most important features from feature space, while the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (BiLSTM) module classifies the probability of sleep apnea. Using a cross-validation scheme, the proposed XGBoost_BiLSTM algorithm achieves an accuracy of 97% while using only the six most significant features from the dataset. The model’s performance is also compared with conventional long-short-term memory networks (LSTM) and other state-of-the-art ML models. The results of the study suggest that the proposed model improved the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea by identifying the risk factors. © 2023, The Author(s).;Computer vision--Deep learning--Feature engineering--Sleep apnea;Blood pressure--Brain--Cardiology--Computer vision--Diagnosis--Diseases--E-learning--Health risks--Heart--Learning systems--Sleep research--Deep learning--Electronic health--Feature engineerings--Health data--Machine learning models--Memory network--Obstructive sleep apnea--Predictive power--Risk factors--Sleep apnea--Long short-term memory;Springer Science and Business Media B.V.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85177889861

There is no substantial study in medical research that focuses on sophisticated planning techniques to uncover links and patterns in data. CAD is a serious health problem that affects people all over the world, especially in low- and middle-income nations. Therefore a low economic heart disease diagnostic application is necessary to crossover the subsequent limitation. Because of this social activity in the present situation, there should be an efficient as well as low economy heart disease diagnosis application design is compulsory. So, in this work RCNN based model has been designed for future generations. Various forms of Deep learning and intelligent technologies are used to extract important information in the case of predicting heart disease. However, the ideal findings’ discovering metrics such as sensitivity, F1-score, and reliability are not satisfactory. In this study of research, proposes a CAD risk prediction model using RCNN is a DL (Deep Learning) technique. In the next two decades, it will continue to be the leading cause of death. The major goal of this study is to apply the findings to existing methodologies. ML (Machine Learning) Techniques are employed to improve a doctor’s treatment decisions and diagnosis using Artificial Intelligence (AI). This work extremely examines the key components of systems, as well as relevant theories such as Gaussian Navies Bayes, Decision Tree (DT), K-NN, and RCNN. The suggested methodology combines AI and data mining to produce precise results with low error rates. This study sets the stage for the improvement of a novel risk prediction model in the field of CAD, with results such as accuracy 99.173%, precision 99.164%, recall 98.69%, sensitivity 98.3%, and specificity 0.0009.

Based on clinical data, a Machine Learning (ML) system can detect cardiac disease in its early stages, which enables a reduction in mortality rates. However, imbalanced and high dimensionality data have been a persistent challenge in ML, impeding accurate predictive data analysis in many real-world applications, such as the detection of cardiovascular disease. To address this, computational methods targeting heart disease detection have been developed. However, their performance is still inadequate. Hence, this study presents a new stack predictor for the heart disease model (termed SPFHD). SPFHD employs five common tree-based ensemble learning algorithms as base models for heart disease detection. In addition, the predictions from the base models are integrated using a support vector machine algorithm to enhance the accuracy of heart disease detection. A new conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) based method is developed to overcome the imbalance issue, which performs better than the conventional balancing methods. Finally, the SPFHD model is tuned by Bayesian optimization. The results show that the proposed SPFHD model outperforms the state-of-art methods over four datasets achieving higher f1-score of 4.68 %, 4.55 %, 2 %, and 1 % for HD clinical, Z-Alizadeh Sani, Statlog, and Cleveland, respectively. Moreover, this new framework offers vital interpretations which assist in understanding model success by leveraging the powerful SHapley Additive explanation (SHAP) algorithm. This highlights the most significant attributes for detecting heart disease and overcoming the limitations of current 'Black-box' methods that cannot reveal causal relationships between features. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd;Conditional variational auto-encoder--Heart disease--Hyperparameter optimization--SHAP--Stacking ensemble learning--Tree ensemble;Balancing--Cardiology--Heart--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Signal encoding--Support vector machines--Auto encoders--Conditional variational auto-encoder--Ensemble learning--Heart disease--Hyper-parameter optimizations--Shapley--Shapley additive explanation--Stacking ensemble learning--Stackings--Tree ensembles--Article--artificial neural network--autoencoder--cardiovascular disease--cardiovascular risk factor--classification--classifier--comparative study--controlled study--convolutional neural network--deep neural network--electrocardiogram--feature selection--genetic algorithm--heart disease--heart failure--human--k nearest neighbor--learning--learning algorithm--machine learning--major clinical study--methodology--minority group--particle swarm optimization--prediction--principal component analysis--random forest--risk assessment--sleep apnea syndromes--support vector machine--Diseases;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85174709260

By metabolomics analysis using Ultra High-performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass/Mass (UPLC-MS/MS), a total of 36 significantly altered metabolites (VIP >1.0) were identified between FCHD and non-FCHD groups. Two logistic regression models and four support vector machine (SVM) models exhibited strong performance and clinical utility in the training set (area under the curve (AUC) = 1.00). The convolutional neural network (CNN) model also demonstrated commendable performance and clinical utility (AUC = 0.89 in the training set). Notably, in the validation set, the performance of the CNN model (AUC = 0.66, precision = 0.714) exhibited better robustness than the six models above (AUC≤0.50). In conclusion, the CNN model based on pseudo-MS images holds promise for real-world and clinical applications due to its better repeatability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.;Congenital heart disease--Convolutional neural networks--Diagnostic model--Metabolomics;Cardiology--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--High performance liquid chromatography--Image enhancement--Metabolites--Support vector machines--Areas under the curves--Clinical utility--Congenital heart disease--Convolutional neural network--Diagnostic model--Metabolomics--Neural network model--Performance--Performance utilities--Training sets--Neural network models;Elsevier B.V.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85190717006

Therefore, early detection through screening is crucial. This study aimed to propose a novel method to enhance LVH detection using 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms with a two-dimensional (2D) convolutional neural network (CNN). Methods: Utilizing 42,127 pairs of ECG-transthoracic echocardiogram data, we pre-processed raw data into single-shot images derived from each ECG lead and conducted lead selection to optimize LVH diagnosis. Our proposed one-shot screening method, implemented during pre-processing, enables the superimposition of waveform source data of any length onto a single-frame image, thereby addressing the limitations of the one-dimensional (1D) approach. We developed a deep learning model with a 2D-CNN structure and machine learning models for LVH detection. To assess our method, we also compared our results with conventional ECG criteria and those of a prior study that used a 1D-CNN approach, utilizing the same dataset from the University of Tokyo Hospital for LVH diagnosis. Results: For LVH detection, the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.916 for the 2D-CNN model, which was significantly higher than that obtained using logistic regression and random forest methods, as well as the two conventional ECG criteria (AUROC of 0.766, 0.790, 0.599, and 0.622, respectively). Incorporating additional metadata, such as ECG measurement data, further improved the average AUROC to 0.921. The model's performance remained stable across two different annotation criteria and demonstrated significant superiority over the performance of the 1D-CNN model used in a previous study (AUROC of 0.807). Conclusions: This study introduces a robust and computationally efficient method that outperforms 1D-CNN models utilized in previous studies for LVH detection. Our method can transform waveforms of any length into fixed-size images and leverage the selected lead of the ECG, ensuring adaptability in environments with limited computational resources. The proposed method holds promise for integration into clinical practice as a tool for early diagnosis, potentially enhancing patient outcomes by facilitating earlier treatment and management. © 2024;Convolutional neural network--Deep learning model--Echocardiography--Electrocardiogram--Ensemble neural network--Left ventricular hypertrophy;Echocardiography--Electrocardiography--Humans--Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular--Mass Screening--Neural Networks, Computer--Cardiology--Chemical detection--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Forestry--Learning systems--Pathology--Patient treatment--Automatic Detection--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning model--Ensemble neural network--Learning models--Left ventricular hypertrophies--Neural network model--Receiver operating characteristic curves--Two-dimensional--Waveforms--adult--Article--clinical practice--comparative study--controlled study--convolutional neural network--decision making--deep learning--early diagnosis--electrocardiogram--electrocardiography--female--heart left ventricle mass--human--k fold cross validation--left ventricular end-diastolic diameter--left ventricular hypertrophy--machine learning--major clinical study--male--middle aged--nerve cell network--sensitivity and specificity--transthoracic echocardiography--two dimensional echocardiography--waveform--artificial neural network--diagnostic imaging--echocardiography--left ventricular hypertrophy--mass screening--procedures--Electrocardiograms;Elsevier Ireland Ltd;38428250;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85186550035

Precisely predicting these comorbidities is crucial for providing personalized care and making well-informed clinical decisions. However, there is a shortage of research investigating the identification of risk factors associated with ACS comorbidities and accurately predicting their likelihood of occurrence beyond heart failure. In this study, an approach called Combined-task Deep Network based on LassoNet feature selection (CDNL) is presented for predicting ACS comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and heart failure. In order to identify crucial biomarkers associated with ACS comorbidities, the proposed framework first incorporates LassoNet, which extends Lasso regression to the deep network by adding a skip (residual) layer. Additionally, a correlation score calculation method across tasks is introduced based on measuring the overlap of identified biomarkers and their assigned importance. This method enables the development of an optimal combined-task prediction model for each ACS comorbidity, addressing the challenge of limited representations in traditional multi-task learning. Our evaluation, conducted through a meticulous cross-sectional study at a tertiary hospital in China, involved a dataset of 2941 samples with 42 clinical features. The results demonstrate that CDNL facilitates the identification of significant biomarkers and achieves an average improvement in AUC of 4.93% and 8.58% compared to deep learning multi-layer neural network (DNN) and SVM, respectively. Additionally, it shows an average improvement of 2.64% and 1.92% compared to two state-of-the-art multi-task models. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd;Acute coronary syndrome--Comorbidity--LassoNet--Multi-task learning;Acute Coronary Syndrome--Biomarkers--Comorbidity--Cross-Sectional Studies--Heart Failure--Humans--Cardiology--Deep learning--Feature Selection--Forecasting--Heart--Learning systems--Multilayer neural networks--Network layers--Patient treatment--Support vector machines--biological marker--biological marker--Acute coronary syndrome--Clinical decision--Comorbidities--Condition--Coronary syndromes--Features selection--Heart failure--Lassonet--Multitask learning--Network-based--acute coronary syndrome--area under the curve--Article--calculation--China--clinical feature--comorbidity--controlled study--cross-sectional study--deep learning--diabetes mellitus--feature selection--heart failure--human--hyperlipidemia--hypertension--least absolute shrinkage and selection operator--tertiary care center--acute coronary syndrome--comorbidity--complication--heart failure--Biomarkers;Elsevier Ltd;38242014;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85183466579

A recent World Heart Federation study shows that cardiovascular disease is responsible for one in every three deaths. Stress, alcohol, smoking, poor diet, lack of exercise, and other linked health issues including diabetes or high blood pressure can all contribute to cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, most cardiovascular disease. There is known to be a complete cure for linked disorders when detected early. Emerging novel data analysis strategies may allow for early detection of cardiovascular disease by examining a patient's medical file. Cardiovascular disease is currently predicted using clinical datasets and machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, because of the disparity in classes and high dimension, clinical datasets pose significant challenges. To address such issues, a dynamic model is proposed. In this paper, an effective decision support (or assistive) system is proposed by combining a deep learning classifier and an optimization technique to detect and classify cardiovascular diseases. It is expected that combining the two strategies will increase the effectiveness of current approaches for using clinical records to anticipate cardiovascular disease. According to clinical data and the severity level of the patient, a deep learning system can anticipate cardiovascular disease in its initial stages, lowering rates of death. The optimization method determines the best parameters for a sufficient quantity of synthesised samples to achieve the best prediction with an optimised classifier. In addition, various parameters such as accuracy, PSNR, sensitivity, specificity, and others were computed and compared with existing systems in this work. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.;Cardiovascular disease--Deep learning--Dynamic modal--Medical--Optimization;Blood pressure--Cardiology--Decision support systems--Deep learning--Diseases--Cardiovascular disease--Causes of death--Deep learning--Dynamic modal--Heart disease--Hybrid model--Learning techniques--Medical--Optimisations--Optimization techniques--Learning systems;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85185722063

Nonetheless, the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) methods for this type of mobile health (mHealth) application requires highly accurate and lightweight AI models that can be deployed in consumer-grade mobile devices. This study presents a lightweight deep learning model and a self-supervised learning (SSL) method to utilise unlabelled data to improve the accuracy of valvular heart disease classification using phonocardiogram data. Methods: This study proposes a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) that consists of ten times fewer parameters than other deep learning models to classify phonocardiogram data. SSL is applied to harness a large collection of unlabelled data as pre-training to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the model and reduce the number of epochs required to converge. A mobile application prototype that encapsulates the model is developed to perform in-device inference and fine-turning. Results: The proposed lightweight model achieves an average accuracy of 98.65% in 10-fold cross-validation. When coupled with SSL using unlabelled data, the pre-trained model can reach an average accuracy higher than 99.4% in 10-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, SSL-trained models have a 4–20% improvement in classification accuracy over non-SSL-trained models when tested with perturbed or noisy data, suggesting that SSL improves robustness of the model. When deployed on common smartphones, in-device fine-tuning and inference of the model can be completed within 0.03–0.37 s, which is considerably faster than 0.22–5.7 s by a standard CNN model that have ten times the number of parameters. Our lightweight model also consumes only a third of the power compared to the larger standard model. Conclusion: This work presents a lightweight and accurate phonocardiogram classifier that supports near real-time performance on standard mobile devices. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.;Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Digital health--Mobile health--Self-supervised learning--Valvular heart diseases screening;Algorithms--Artificial Intelligence--Heart Valve Diseases--Humans--Neural Networks, Computer--Supervised Machine Learning--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep neural networks--Diseases--E-learning--Heart--Learning systems--Phonocardiography--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Digital health--Disease screening--Heart disease--Learning models--Phonocardiograms--Self-supervised learning--Unlabeled data--Valvular heart disease screening--algorithm--Article--back propagation--binary classification--classification algorithm--classifier--comparative study--controlled study--convolutional neural network--cross validation--deep learning--deep neural network--diagnostic accuracy--edge device compatible algorithm--energy consumption--human--nanoencapsulation--phonocardiography--self supervised learning--valvular heart disease--algorithm--artificial intelligence--artificial neural network--diagnostic imaging--supervised machine learning--valvular heart disease--mHealth;Elsevier Ireland Ltd;37950925;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85176279374

The electrocardiogram remains one of the most important, fastest, cheapest, and noninvasive methods of diagnosis in cardiology, despite the rapid development and progression of the technology. Even if studied a long time ago, it still has a lot of less understood features that, with a better understanding, can give more clues to a correct and prompt diagnosis in a short time. The use of AI in the interpretation of the ECG improved the accuracy and the time to diagnosis in different cardiovascular diseases, and more than this, explaining the decision to make AI diagnosis improved the human understanding of the different features of the ECG that might be considered for a more accurate diagnosis.

In early diagnosis, cardiovascular may be less severe and this may decrease the death rates. Distinguishing risk factors utilizing deep learning models is a hopeful methodology. Our research is based on the “Efficient Prediction of Cardiovascular Disease Using Machine Learning Algorithms With Relief and LASSO Feature Selection Techniques” gives the accuracy of 99.05% and we have extended this research by applying deep learning models, ANN, and CNN for prediction of heart disease from their health measures. L2 regularization technique is applied on these models to handle overfitting problem and the same dataset is applied for getting more accuracy in the result so that the physician diagnoses the ailment with confidence. To generate reliable data for the training model, we effectively collected data, processed data, and transformed data. For the evaluation of the proposed method, the metrics reveal accuracy, sensitivity, precision, recall, and F1-Score. The proposed method, ANN, gives 98% accuracy, and the CNN method gives 95% accuracy with L2 regularization. Hence, the ANN model gives the best accuracy result. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.;ANN--CNN--Deep learning--Heart disease--L2 regularization;Cardiology--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Forecasting--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Regression analysis--ANN--Cardiovascular disease--Death rates--Deep learning--Early diagnosis--Heart disease--L2 regularization--Learning models--Regularisation--Risk factors--Diseases;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85187804481

The classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings can diagnose Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and other types of arrhythmia. Short ECG segments recorded from wearable devices in an IoT-based system can further provide continuous abnormality detection. The performance of ECG classification is usually high in normal segments, but much lower in the target classes, i.e., AF and other arrhythmias, which could result from class imbalance and limited feature representation. Deep learning methods have been employed as feature extractors in previous studies. Among them, convolutional neural networks (CNN) can generate rich features in different scales. But CNN may omit precise temporal information such as the duration between R-waves in two QRS waves (RR interval) irregularity, which is insensitive to noise segments. Thus, aiming at improving the classification performance of AF and other classes in short ECG segments, we propose a hybrid feature fusion method integrating the above-mentioned features. The fused features are trained and tested in a support vector machine classifier. The F1-score results show that our method outperforms not only the same CNN method without feature fusion in all the four classes, which average F1-score reached 84.3% and classification time per single sample of 0.005 s, but also several state-of-the-art methods, especially in the target classes, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed method. We then further discuss the impact of length on the performance of the proposed method, providing insights into future applications. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.;CNN--ECG--Feature fusion--IoT applications;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Diseases--Internet of things--Learning systems--Support vector machines--Atrial fibrillation--Convolutional neural network--F1 scores--Features fusions--Healthcare systems--Hybrid features--IoT application--Optimisations--Performance--Target class--Electrocardiograms;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85118996473

This is particularly true for patients with lifelong HF sequelae of cardiovascular disease such as patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). Purpose: We developed hART (heart failure Attentive Risk Trajectory), a deep-learning model to predict HF trajectories in CHD patients. Methods: hART is designed to capture the contextual relationships between medical events within a patient's history. It is trained to predict future HF risk by using the masked self-attention mechanism that forces it to focus only on the most relevant segments of the past medical events. Results: To demonstrate the utility of hART, we used a large cohort containing healthcare administrative data from the Quebec CHD database (137,493 patients, 35-year follow-up). hART achieves an area under the precision-recall of 28% for HF risk prediction, which is 33% improvement over existing methods. Patients with severe CHD lesion showed a consistently elevated predicted HF risks throughout their lifespan, and patients with genetic syndromes exhibited elevated HF risks until the age of 50. The impact of the birth condition decreases on long-term HF risk. The timing of interventions such as arrhythmia surgery had varying impacts on the lifespan HF risk among the individuals. Arrhythmic surgery performed at a younger age had minimal long-term effects on HF risk, while surgeries during adulthood had a significant lasting impact. Conclusion: Together, we show that hART can detect meaningful lifelong HF risk in CHD patients by capturing both long and short-range dependencies in their past medical events. © 2024 The Author(s);CHD morbidity--Heart failure hospitalization prediction--Longitudinal outcome prediction--Machine learning;Adult--Cardiovascular Diseases--Deep Learning--Heart Defects, Congenital--Heart Failure--Humans--Longevity--Risk Factors--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Heart--Hospitals--Surgery--Trajectories--Comorbidities--Congenital heart disease--Congenital heart disease morbidity--Failure risk--Heart failure--Heart failure hospitalization prediction--Lifespans--Longitudinal outcome prediction--Machine-learning--Outcome prediction--adult--Article--cardiac patient--cardiovascular risk--cohort analysis--congenital heart disease--controlled study--deep learning--disease severity--female--follow up--genetic disorder--heart arrhythmia--heart failure--heart surgery--human--lifespan--major clinical study--male--medical history--mortality risk--predictive model--cardiovascular disease--complication--congenital heart malformation--heart failure--longevity--risk factor--Forecasting;Elsevier Ireland Ltd;38395016;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85185555134

Since early discovery significantly improves survival chances, precise prediction techniques are essential. There are new paths for more accurate CVD prediction due to emerging technologies like machine learning (ML). Heart disease may now be identified in its early stages using several machine learning algorithms, which can aid in future treatments. However, none of the existing algorithms achieve high accuracy and frequently fail because of bias and over-fitting. To improve the prediction accuracy of cardiovascular disease, a new innovative approach is proposed in this research by utilizing deep learning techniques to identify significant features. For efficient CVD prediction, we propose a hybrid deep-learning intelligent system. Tests and assessments have been conducted using the five benchmark datasets for cardiac disease from the UCI repository. Three data processing techniques are first utilized in the pre-processing stage to improve the dataset's quality by preventing undesired distortions: outlier removal, replacing missing values, and resolving data imbalance problems. Next, deep learning-based Modified DenseNet201 (MDenseNet201) extracts the disease-related features. Relief and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) approaches are used to select the appropriate features. Finally, a deep learning-based improved deep residual shrinkage network (IDRSNet) is employed to predict cardiovascular disease. The accuracy of the proposed model on the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository dataset is 99.12%. Based on experimental results, the proposed hybrid deep learning system produced more excellent accuracy for CVD prediction than existing approaches. The combined intelligent system (MDensNet201-IDRSNet), which generates the best practical solution out of all input prediction models considering performance criteria, makes it possible for physicians and radiologists to diagnose cardiac patients more accurately. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd;Cardiovascular disease (CVD)--CVD prediction--Deep learning--Modified DenseNet201--UCI repository;Cardiology--Data handling--Deep learning--Diseases--Heart--Intelligent systems--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Shrinkage--Cardiovascular disease--Cardiovascular disease prediction--Common disease--Deep learning--Modified densenet201--Prediction systems--University of California--University of california irvine repository--adult--aged--Article--cardiac patient--cardiovascular disease--controlled study--data processing--deep learning--diagnostic accuracy--female--human--major clinical study--male--modified densenet201--Forecasting;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85186764052

Arrhythmia, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and other cardiac illnesses have always been serious disorders that put patients' lives in danger. Different studies have shown that substantial features play a foremost role in enhancing the machine learning (ML) technique's performance. Moreover, the dataset was imbalanced, and the researchers could not utilize any model to deal with this issue. Thus, the objective is to discover the substantial features and solve the class imbalance problem that can boost accuracy and lead to better predicting cardiovascular patient survivors. In this proposed work, a novel SMOTE-based hybrid deep learning (SMOTE-HDL) network is proposed for predicting the patient's survivors of cardiovascular disease. At first, the data acquisition stage collects the input data from the dataset and then pre-processes using data normalization and missing value imputation. In addition, the class imbalance problem is solved by an oversampling technique named the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). To extract the substantial features, an attention-based perceptive long short-term extraction network (APLSTEN) is employed. The process of feature selection is accomplished through an adaptive coati optimization algorithm (ACOA). Finally, the selected features are served to a Kepler-optimized deep stacked recurrent network (KDSRN) for attaining enhanced classification. The proposed SMOTE-HDL network is implemented in the Python platform using the Heat-failure-clinical-records dataset and assessed the performance in response to dissimilar evaluation criteria. The maximum prediction accuracy obtained by the proposed SMOTE-HDL is 95.52%, superior to the existing classifiers. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.;Cardiovascular disease--Coati optimization algorithm--Kepler optimization--Missing value imputation--Stacked Autoencoder--Synthetic minority oversampling technique;Cardiology--Data acquisition--Deep learning--Diseases--Forecasting--Learning systems--Optimization--Auto encoders--Cardiovascular disease--Coati optimization algorithm--Keple optimization--Missing value imputation--Optimisations--Optimization algorithms--Performance--Stacked autoencoder--Synthetic minority over-sampling techniques--Python;Springer;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85182639398

However, predicting heart disease is a complex task and diagnosis results are rarely accurate. To address this issue, a novel Recommendation System for Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Using IoT Network (DEEP-CARDIO) has been proposed for providing prior diagnosis, treatment, and dietary recommendations for cardiac diseases. Initially, the physiological data are collected from the patient&#x2019;s remotely by using the four bio sensors such as ECG sensor, Pressure sensor, Pulse sensor and Glucose sensor. An Arduino controller receives the collected data from the IoT sensors to predict and diagnose the disease. A cardiovascular disease prediction model is implemented by using BiGRU (Bidirectional-Gated Recurrent Unit) attention model which diagnose the cardiovascular disease and classify into five available cardiovascular classes. The recommendation system provides physical and dietary recommendations to cardiac patients based on the classified data, via user mobile application. The performance of the DEEP-CARDIO is validated by Cloud Simulator (CloudSim) using the real-time Framingham&#x2019;s and Statlog heart disease dataset. The proposed DEEP CARDIO method achieves an overall accuracy of 99.90% whereas, the MABC-SVM, HCBDA and MLbPM method achieves 86.91%, 88.65% and 93.63% respectively.

It is required to detect, prevent and manage cardiovascular diseases to reduce their effect and improve the outcome. Interpretation of ECG signals may vary from one expert to another. That's why an automatic categorization of ECG recordings is needed. Aim: The proposed study attempted to address the above issues by developing an automated method for predicting arrhythmias based on ECG signal categorization. This method would offer more precise and enhanced interpretation of ECGs while reducing small biases brought on by manual interpretation. Methods: In this paper, a unique deep learning-based algorithm is used to efficiently and swiftly classify cardiac arrhythmias. We have used Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) to appropriately classify ECG data into important arrhythmia categories during the pre-processing stage by removing intrinsic noise from ECG signals. To obtain optimal placement (equilibrium state) for better search space diversification, OB-L-EO uses Laplace distribution followed by opposition-based modelling to modify the intensity of search agents. A powerful type of machine learning technique called deep neural network (DNN) is used to accomplish signal categorization among sixteen categories using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia ECG dataset. Results: With the help of analysing classification technique including optimized feature vector and the OBLEO method with DNN, the heart rate has been detected with a 98.779% accuracy, 98.67% sensitivity, 98.87% specificity and execution time with a value of 1.34 ms across the entire dataset.

Despite their great promise, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of their results, which is a key element for their implementation in clinical practice. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a critical for trustworthy and reliable AI, particularly in safety-critical domains such as medicine. Estimating uncertainty in Machine Learning (ML) model predictions has been extensively used for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection under single-label tasks. However, the use of UQ methods in multi-label classification remains underexplored. This study goes beyond developing highly accurate models comparing five uncertainty quantification methods using the same Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture across various validation scenarios, including internal and external validation as well as OOD detection, taking multi-label ECG classification as the example domain. We show the importance of external validation and its impact on classification performance, uncertainty estimates quality, and calibration. Ensemble-based methods yield more robust uncertainty estimations than single network or stochastic methods. Although current methods still have limitations in accurately quantifying uncertainty, particularly in the case of dataset shift, incorporating uncertainty estimates with a classification with a rejection option improves the ability to detect such changes. Moreover, we show that using uncertainty estimates as a criterion for sample selection in active learning setting results in greater improvements in classification performance compared to random sampling. © 2023 The Author(s);Artificial Intelligence--Cardiology--Multi-label classification--Uncertainty quantification;Classification (of information)--Computer aided diagnosis--Deep neural networks--Learning systems--Safety engineering--Stochastic systems--Uncertainty analysis--Automatic diagnosis--Case-studies--Classification performance--Limited attentions--Multi-label classifications--Quantification methods--Research communities--Uncertainty--Uncertainty estimates--Uncertainty quantifications--Electrocardiograms;Elsevier B.V.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85169003933

Its use can improve diagnosis and therapy in many areas of medicine. Despite this enormous progress, many physicians perceive it as a black box and are skeptical about it. This review will present the basics of machine learning. Different classifications of artificial intelligence, such as supervised versus unsupervised and discriminative versus generative AI, are given. Analogies to human intelligence are discussed as far as algorithms are oriented toward it. In the second step, the most common models like random forest, k-means clustering, convolutional neural network, and transformers will be presented in a way that the underlying idea can be understood. Corresponding medical applications in cardiovascular medicine will be named for all models, respectively. The overview is intended to show that the term artificial intelligence covers a wide range of different concepts. It should help physicians understand the principles of AI to make up one's minds about its application in cardiology. It should also enable them to evaluate results obtained with AI's help critically. © 2023 The Authors.

The complexity of CVD arises from its multifaceted nature, influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Traditional diagnostic approaches often struggle to effectively integrate and interpret the heterogeneous data associated with CVD. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a novel Attention-Based Cross-Modal (ABCM) transfer learning framework. This framework innovatively merges diverse data types, including clinical records, medical imagery, and genetic information, through an attention-driven mechanism. This mechanism adeptly identifies and focuses on the most pertinent attributes from each data source, thereby enhancing the model's ability to discern intricate interrelationships among various data types. Our extensive testing and validation demonstrate that the ABCM framework significantly surpasses traditional single-source models and other advanced multi-source methods in predicting CVD. Specifically, our approach achieves an accuracy of 93.5%, precision of 92.0%, recall of 94.5%, and an impressive area under the curve (AUC) of 97.2%. These results not only underscore the superior predictive capability of our model but also highlight its potential in offering more accurate and early detection of CVD. The integration of cross-modal data through attention-based mechanisms provides a deeper understanding of the disease, paving the way for more informed clinical decision-making and personalized patient care. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd;Attention mechanisms--Cardiovascular disease prediction--Cross-modal transfer learning--Multimodal feature fusion--Transformer based models;Area Under Curve--Cardiovascular Diseases--Clinical Decision-Making--Humans--Learning--Machine Learning--Cardiology--Decision making--Diagnosis--Diseases--Genes--Learning systems--Modal analysis--Attention mechanisms--Cardiovascular disease--Cardiovascular disease prediction--Cross-modal--Cross-modal transfer learning--Datatypes--Learning frameworks--Multimodal feature fusions--Transfer learning--Transformer based model--Article--cardiovascular disease--clinical decision making--comparative study--computer language--controlled study--convolutional neural network--decision tree--deep learning--deep neural network--diagnostic accuracy--diagnostic test accuracy study--electrocardiogram--electronic health record--feed forward neural network--health care personnel--heart infarction--human--long short term memory network--machine learning--Monte Carlo method--prediction--risk assessment--support vector machine--transfer of learning--area under the curve--learning--Forecasting;Elsevier Ltd;38217974;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85182260422

Realizing this doctrine requires an efficient adaptation of molecular discoveries into the clinic. We present an approach to facilitate this process by describing the Imageable Genome, the part of the human genome whose expression can be assessed via molecular imaging. Using a deep learning-based hybrid human-AI pipeline, we bridge individual genes and their relevance in human diseases with specific molecular imaging methods. Cross-referencing the Imageable Genome with RNA-seq data from over 60,000 individuals reveals diagnostic, prognostic and predictive imageable genes for a wide variety of major human diseases. Having both the critical size and focus to be altered in its expression during the development and progression of any human disease, the Imageable Genome will generate new imaging tools that improve the understanding, diagnosis and management of human diseases. © 2023, The Author(s).;;Diagnostic Imaging--Genome--Humans--4 aminobutyric acid receptor--adenosine receptor--aptamer--ar a014418 c 11--azafol f 18--cholinergic receptor--contrast medium--cpfpx f 18--dizocilpine fluoromethyl f 18--dopamine transporter--dota tctp 1 galium ga 68--epithelial cell adhesion molecule--epoxide hydrolase--flumazenil f 18--fluoroethylnormemantine f 18--fndp f 18--folate receptor--fp1op f 18--fph f 18--gelatinase B--glutamate metabotropic receptor--glycogen synthase kinase--haptoglobin--inos 9 f 18--ionotropic receptor--matrix metalloproteinase 26--metabotropic receptor--nitric oxide synthase--reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase--tracer--transcriptome--transforming growth factor--unclassified drug--gene expression--genome--molecular analysis--Article--artificial intelligence--atrial fibrillation--autism--bipolar disorder--brain metastasis--breast cancer--cancer prognosis--cardiac imaging--cardiology--clear cell carcinoma--clinical assessment--colon cancer--congenital heart disease--coronary artery disease--coronavirus disease 2019--data science--deep learning--diagnostic imaging--diagnostic test--dilated cardiomyopathy--disease association--disease exacerbation--diseases--gene--gene expression--genetic analysis--genomic instability--genomics--human--human cell--human genome--imageable genome--liver cancer--lung adenocarcinoma--machine learning--major clinical study--melanoma--molecular imaging--molecular medicine--natural language processing--neurology--nuclear magnetic resonance imaging--oncology--ovary cancer--positron emission tomography--predictive value--primary tumor--RNA sequencing--schizophrenia--single photon emission computed tomography--systems biology--uterine cervix cancer--diagnostic imaging--genome;Nature Research;37957176;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85176416075

We trained and internally validated a dynamic machine learning (ML) model and neural network that extracted features from longitudinally collected electrocardiograms (ECG), and used these to predict the risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Methods: A multicentre study in patients implanted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) between 2007 and 2021 in two academic hospitals was performed. Variational autoencoders (VAEs), which combine neural networks with variational inference principles, and can learn patterns and structure in data without explicit labelling, were trained to encode the mean ECG waveforms from the limb leads into 16 variables. Supervised dynamic ML models using these latent ECG representations and clinical baseline information were trained to predict malignant ventricular arrhythmias treated by the ICD. Model performance was evaluated on a hold-out set, using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and calibration curves. Findings: 2942 patients (61.7 ± 13.9 years, 25.5% female) were included, with a total of 32,129 ECG recordings during a mean follow-up of 43.9 ± 35.9 months. The mean time-varying area under the ROC curve for the dynamic model was 0.738 ± 0.07, compared to 0.639 ± 0.03 for a static (i.e. baseline-only model). Feature analyses indicated dynamic changes in latent ECG representations, particularly those affecting the T-wave morphology, were of highest importance for model predictions. Interpretation: Dynamic ML models and neural networks effectively leverage routinely collected longitudinal ECG recordings for personalised and updated predictions of malignant ventricular arrhythmias, outperforming static models.

I am therefore delighted to respond to Adrian Ionescu’s comments, although I think he has got it wrong—as I will aim to demonstrate. In the spirit of this debate, please indulge me while I too let off some steam! I have always disliked the fact that one of the subspecialties within cardiology, which did not exist when I qualified in the 1970s, has come to be known as “cardiac imaging.” Cardiac diagnosis is not about pictures, although some conditions are indeed instantly recognizable. Usually, what we need to know to understand disease is how the heart is functioning, much more than what it looks like. That is true for coronary arteriography as much as for non-invasive imaging. If I am forced to adopt a subspeciality label, then I would much prefer to be considered a clinical pathophysiologist. Accurate diagnosis is the sine qua non of logical evidence-based clinical practice, yet we often get it wrong. And there remain many patients with disease that we cannot diagnose precisely because we do not understand it sufficiently. Why does this patient with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction have impaired left ventricular function? Why does that patient with normal blood pressure have left ventricular hypertrophy? In this patient in sinus rhythm, which particular aspects of cardiovascular function will influence the development of dementia? Cardiologists who are expert in performing, analyzing, and interpreting detailed echocardiographic and cardiovascular investigations are needed to give us the best chance of answering such questions. They cannot be replaced by an uninterpretable computer algorithm when no-one yet knows the answer—but by staying in control, researchers can use artificial intelligence (AI) to help their thinking. © 2023 MediaMed Publicis.

Artificial intelligence offers significant opportunities to enhance risk assessment, diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of athletes. This article explores the application of AI in various aspects of sports cardiology, including imaging techniques, genetic testing, and wearable devices. The use of machine learning and deep neural networks enables improved analysis and interpretation of complex datasets. However, ethical and legal dilemmas must be addressed, including informed consent, algorithmic fairness, data privacy, and intellectual property issues. The integration of AI technologies should complement the expertise of physicians, allowing for a balanced approach that optimizes patient care and outcomes. Ongoing research and collaborations are vital to harness the full potential of AI in sports cardiology and advance our management of cardiovascular health in athletes. © The Author(s) 2024.

However, because these datasets do not contain the strict pairing of randomized control trials, matching techniques are to draw comparisons among patients. A key limitation to such techniques is verification that the variables used to model treatment decision making are also relevant in identifying the risk of major adverse events. This article explores a deep mixture of experts approach to jointly learn how to match patients and model the risk of major adverse events in patients. Although trained with information regarding treatment and outcomes, after training, the proposed model is decomposable into a network that clusters patients into phenotypes from information available before treatment. This model is validated on a dataset of patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock. The mixture of experts approach can predict the outcome of mortality with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 ± 0.01 while jointly discovering five potential phenotypes of interest. The technique and interpretation allow for identifying clinically relevant phenotypes that may be used both for outcomes modeling as well as potentially evaluating individualized treatment effects.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).;Cardiology--cardiovascular outcomes--machine learning--medical information systems--mixture of experts;Bioinformatics--Information use--Machine learning--Medical computing--Medical information systems--Patient treatment--Risk perception--Adverse events--Cardiovascular outcome--Machine-learning--Matchings--Medical data--Mixture of experts--Phenotyping--Randomized control trials--Risk estimation--Treatment decision makings--acute heart infarction--adult--aged--Article--cardiogenic shock--clinical feature--clinical outcome--false negative result--false positive result--female--human--machine learning--major clinical study--male--middle aged--mixture of experts--mortality rate--randomized controlled trial--Cardiology;Association for Computing Machinery;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85178031293

Many risk factors for heart disease are associated with prompt access to reliable, dependable, and practical early diagnosis and disease management procedures. Identifying heart disease through early-stage signs is challenging in today’s global climate. If not caught in time, this could result in death. When there are no heart specialist doctors in remote, semi-urban, or rural areas, precise risk prediction and analysis might be critical in the early-stage identification of heart disorders. Machine learning (ML) and Deep learning (DL) approaches were employed in this study to assess massive volumes of complex medical data, supporting specialists in predicting heart illness and mortality from heart failure. This study used two datasets: one to forecast heart disease and the other to analyze and forecast death due to heart failure. Predicting cardiac illnesses using Artificial Neural Networks is 91.52% accurate (ANN). The bagging ensemble predicted heart failure with 90% accuracy. The primary contribution of this research is an ensemble strategy with high performance that multiple measurements have demonstrated to predict heart failure and cardiac disorders using ANN. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.;Artificial Neural Network--Ensemble--Healthcare--Heart Disease--Heart Failure--Machine Learning;Artificial heart--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Forecasting--Learning systems--Neural networks--Risk analysis--Risk assessment--Cardiovascular disease--Early diagnosis--Ensemble--Healthcare--Heart disease--Heart failure--Machine learning models--Machine-learning--Prediction of heart disease--Risk factors--Heart;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85175970568

Machine learning and deep learning-based models can learn the embedded patterns in the electrocardiogram to estimate complex metrics such as age and gender that depend on multiple aspects of human physiology. ECG estimated age with respect to the chronological age reflects the overall well-being of the cardiovascular system, with significant positive deviations indicating an aged cardiovascular system and a higher likelihood of cardiovascular mortality. Several conventional, machine learning, and deep learning-based methods have been proposed to estimate age from electronic health records, health surveys, and ECG data. This manuscript comprehensively reviews the methodologies proposed for ECG-based age and gender estimation over the last decade. Specifically, the review highlights that elevated ECG age is associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, abnormal peripheral endothelial dysfunction, and high mortality, among many other cardiovascular disorders. Furthermore, the survey presents overarching observations and insights across methods for age and gender estimation. This paper also presents several essential methodological improvements and clinical applications of ECG-estimated age and gender to encourage further improvements of the state-of-the-art methodologies. © 2023;Artificial intelligence--Cardiovascular diseases--Cardiovascular well-being--Deep learning--Delta age--ECG age estimation--ECG-based Regression--Electrocardiography--Gender estimation--Machine learning--Neural networks--Statistical approaches--Survey;Aged--Electrocardiography--Heart Rate--Humans--Machine Learning--Probability--Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted--Cardiology--Cardiovascular system--Deep learning--Diseases--Learning systems--Age estimation--Cardiovascular disease--Cardiovascular well-being--Deep learning--Delta age--ECG age estimation--ECG-based regression--Gender estimations--Machine-learning--Neural-networks--Statistical approach--Well being--age determination--artificial neural network--calculation--cardiovascular mortality--coronary atherosclerosis--data processing--deep learning--electrocardiography--endothelial dysfunction--feature extraction--gender--human--information processing--neural network theory--pattern recognition--Review--theory--transfer of learning--aged--heart rate--machine learning--physiology--probability--procedures--signal processing--Electrocardiograms;Elsevier B.V.;38042607;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85177994958

Without timely detection and treatment, approximately one-third of children with CHD would die in the infant period. However, due to the complicated heart structures, early diagnosis of CHD and its types is quite challenging, even for experienced radiologists. Here, we present an artificial intelligence (AI) system that achieves a comparable performance of human experts in the critical task of classifying 17 categories of CHD types. We collected the first-large CT dataset from three different CT machines, including more than 3750 CHD patients over 14 years. Experimental results demonstrate that it can achieve diagnosis accuracy (86.03%) comparable with junior cardiovascular radiologists (86.27%) in a World Health Organization appointed research and cooperation center in China on most types of CHD, and obtains a higher sensitivity (82.91%) than junior cardiovascular radiologists (76.18%). The accuracy of the combination of our AI system (97.20%) and senior radiologists achieves comparable results to that of junior radiologists and senior radiologists (97.16%) which is the current clinical routine. Our AI system can further provide 3D visualization of hearts to senior radiologists for interpretation and flexible review, surgeons for precise intuition of heart structures, and clinicians for more precise outcome prediction. We demonstrate the potential of our model to be integrated into current clinic practice to improve the diagnosis of CHD globally, especially in regions where experienced radiologists can be scarce. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.;Artificial intelligence--Computed tomography--Congenital heart disease--Deep learning--Diagnosis;Cardiology--Computerized tomography--Deep learning--Diseases--Heart--Large dataset--Three dimensional computer graphics--'current--Artificial intelligence systems--Birth defects--Computed tomography--Computed tomography images--Congenital heart disease--Deep learning--Early diagnosis--Heart structures--Performance--aortic arch anomaly--aortic arch hypoplasia--aortic arch interruption--aortic coarctation--Article--artificial intelligence--computer assisted diagnosis--computer assisted tomography--congenital heart disease--congenital heart malformation--controlled study--cross validation--diagnostic accuracy--Fallot tetralogy--great vessels transposition--heart atrium septum defect--heart right ventricle double outlet--heart single atrium--heart single ventricle--heart ventricle septum defect--human--image segmentation--lung vein drainage anomaly--patent ductus arteriosus--pulmonary valve atresia--pulmonary valve stenosis--sensitivity and specificity--Diagnosis;Elsevier B.V.;37734140;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85171851951

This study proposes a deep learning hybrid model based coronary heart disease (CAD) prediction method, which can significantly improve the prediction accuracy compared to traditional solutions. This research scheme is based on the data of 7291 patients and proposes a hybrid model, which uses two different deep neural network models and a recurrent neural network model as the main model for training. The prediction results based on the main model training use a k-nearest neighbor model for secondary training so as to improve the accuracy of coronary heart disease prediction. The comparison between the model prediction results and the clinical diagnostic results shows that the prediction model has a prediction accuracy rate of 82.8%, a prediction precision rate of 87.08%, a prediction recall rate of 88.57%, a prediction F1-score of 87.82%, and an area under the curve value of 0.8 in the test set. Compared to single model machine learning predictions, the hybrid model has a significantly improved accuracy and has effectively solved the problem of overfitting. A deep learning based CAD prediction hybrid model that combines multiple weak models into a strong model can fully explore the complex inter-relationships between various features under limited feature values and sample size, improve the evaluation indicators of the prediction model, and provide effective auxiliary support for CAD diagnosis. © 2024 Author(s).;;Coronary Disease--Deep Learning--Humans--Machine Learning--Neural Networks, Computer--Cardiology--Computer aided design--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Heart--Learning systems--Nearest neighbor search--Recurrent neural networks--Coronary heart disease--Hybrid model--Machine-learning--Medical experts--Model-based OPC--Neural network model--Prediction accuracy--Prediction methods--Prediction modelling--Prediction-based--artificial neural network--coronary artery disease--deep learning--human--machine learning--Forecasting;American Institute of Physics Inc.;38276898;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85183454542

Accurate and early prediction of these heart abnormalities require enormous experience along with advanced technology. Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning have contributed extensively as an emerging technology for the prediction of the diseases including heart abnormalities. However, still high accuracy of prediction and less computational complexities remains challenge for the researchers. Currently the prevailing scenario existing post pandemic and new variants coming in, it is very essential to come up with an amalgamation of technology and techniques as assessment for doctors in diagnosis. Proposed article makes use of Convolutional Neural networks (CNN) for detecting and classifying the heart abnormality into three labels as mild, moderate or severe which helps in appropriate treatment of the heart diseases. CNN model is built. The model is trained with datasets corresponding to mild, moderate and severe conditions of heart abnormality. The model is tested extensively for the test data and the performance indices are obtained are with reference to accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1-Score. Proposed work is implemented in the Keras libraries with Tensorflow 2.1.1 as backend. Furthermore, prediction performance and complexity overhead are correlated with the other existing cutting-edge algorithms in predicting the heart abnormalities. Results demonstrates that the proposed model proved to be efficient than the others with high prediction accuracy (99%) and less computational complexities. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.;Artificial intelligence--Classification--CNN model--Decision support system--Deep learning--Machine learning;Cardiology--Computational complexity--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Decision support systems--Deep learning--Diseases--Echocardiography--Forecasting--Heart--Image classification--Learning systems--Accurate prediction--Advanced technology--Convolutional neural network--Convolutional neural network model--Death rates--Deep learning--Early prediction--Echocardiographic images--Machine-learning--Neural network model--Neural network models;Springer;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85173793003

Despite individuals' normal outward appearance and routine activities, subtle indications of these diseases can manifest in the electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, often overlooked by standard interpretation. Current machine learning models have been ineffective in discerning these minor variations due to the irregular and subtle nature of changes in the ECG patterns. This paper uses a novel deep-learning approach to predict slight variations in ECG signals by fine-tuning the learning rate of a deep convolutional neural network. The strategy involves segmenting ECG signals into separate data sequences, each evaluated for unique centroid points. Utilizing a clustering approach, this technique efficiently recognizes minute yet significant variations in the ECG signal characteristics. This method is estimated using a specific dataset from SRM College Hospital and Research Centre, Kattankulathur, Chennai, India, focusing on patients' ECG signals. The model aims to predict the ordinary and subtle variations in ECG signal patterns, which were subsequently mapped to a pre-trained feature set of cardiovascular diseases. The results suggest that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in detecting minor and irregular ECG signal variations. This advancement could significantly enhance the early detection of cardiovascular diseases, offering a promising new tool in predictive medical diagnostics. © 2024;Cardiovascular diseases--Convolutional neural networks (CNNS)--Deep learning--Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals--Pattern Variation prediction;Cardiovascular Diseases--Deep Learning--Electrocardiography--Humans--India--Neural Networks, Computer--Cardiology--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Electrocardiograms--'current--Cardiovascular disease--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Electrocardiogram signal--Learning approach--Pattern variation--Pattern variation prediction--Standard interpretation--Article--benchmarking--cardiovascular disease--clustering algorithm--convolutional neural network--deep learning--deep neural network--disease classification--early diagnosis--electrocardiogram--feature extraction--India--prediction--segmentation algorithm--artificial neural network--electrocardiography--human--Forecasting;Elsevier Ltd;38508789;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85183453724

This scoping review was conducted to capture the breadth of AI applications within cardiovascular science. Employing a structured approach, we sourced relevant articles from PubMed, with an emphasis on journals encompassing general cardiology and digital medicine. We applied filters to highlight cardiovascular articles published in journals focusing on general internal medicine, cardiology and digital medicine, thereby identifying the prevailing trends in the field. Following a comprehensive full-text screening, a total of 140 studies were identified. Over the preceding 5 years, cardiovascular medicine’s interplay with AI has seen an over tenfold augmentation. This expansive growth encompasses multiple cardiovascular subspecialties, including but not limited to, general cardiology, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and arrhythmia. Deep learning emerged as the predominant methodology. The majority of AI endeavors in this domain have been channeled toward enhancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities, utilizing resources such as hospital datasets, electrocardiograms, and echocardiography. A significant uptrend was observed in AI’s application for omics data analysis. However, a clear gap persists in AI’s full-scale integration into the clinical decision-making framework. AI, particularly deep learning, has demonstrated robust applications across cardiovascular subspecialties, indicating its transformative potential in this field. As we continue on this trajectory, ensuring the alignment of technological progress with medical ethics becomes crucial. The abundant digital health data today further accentuates the need for meticulous systematic reviews, tailoring them to each cardiovascular subspecialty.

The QCGAN-ECG constructs a quantum generator based on patch method. In this method, each sub-generator generates distinct features of abnormal heartbeats in different segments. This patch-based generative algorithm conserves quantum resources and makes QCGAN-ECG practical for near-term quantum devices. Additionally, QCGAN-ECG introduces quantum registers as control conditions. It encodes information about the types and probability distributions of abnormal heartbeats into quantum registers, rendering the entire generative process controllable. Simulation experiments on Pennylane demonstrated that the QCGAN-ECG could generate completely abnormal heartbeats with an average accuracy of 88.8%. Moreover, the QCGAN-ECG can accurately fit the probability distribution of various abnormal ECG data. In the anti-noise experiments, the QCGAN-ECG showcased outstanding robustness across various levels of quantum noise interference.

Current detection processes often rely on Electrocardiography (ECG) signal analysis, which requires accurate data processing and feature extraction. Traditional methods have limitations like processing time and accuracy. To address these issues, a novel approach called Gradient Squirrel Search Algorithm-Deep Maxout Network (GSSA-DMN) is proposed for more effective heart disease detection. The proposed GSSA-DMN approach involves several steps. Initially, input data is obtained from a specific database and subjected to data pre-processing, including log scaling for pattern transformation. Feature selection is then performed using ReliefF on the pre-processed data. The core of the approach lies in the Deep Maxout Network (DMN) trained by the Gradient Squirrel Search Algorithm (GSSA), which combines Gradient Descent Optimization (GDO) with the Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA). The GSSA-DMN approach demonstrates remarkable performance. It achieves high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values of approximately 93.2%, 93%, and 91.5%, respectively. These results indicate its effectiveness in heart disease detection. Comparatively, the proposed GSSA-DMN method outperforms existing techniques. Its accuracy surpasses those of other methods by margins of 6.97%, 5.79%, 4.50%, 3.43%, and 1.93% when compared to BF-PSO, Bi-LSTM-CRF, XGBoost, RLNNC, and DMOA-SqueezeNet for K-value. This suggests that GSSA-DMN provides superior accuracy in detecting heart disease. In summary, the GSSA-DMN approach presents a promising solution for improving the accuracy and efficiency of heart disease detection compared to traditional methods and existing state-of-the-art techniques. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd;Deep Maxout Network (DMN)--Gradient descent optimization (GDO)--Log scaling--ReliefF--Squirrel search algorithm (SSA);Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Data handling--Diseases--Feature Selection--Gradient methods--Heart--Learning algorithms--Metadata--Particle swarm optimization (PSO)--Deep maxout network--Disease detection--Gradient descent optimization--Heart disease--Log scaling--ReliefF--Scalings--Search Algorithms--Squirrel search algorithm--analysis--Article--clinical examination--computer assisted tomography--data base--data processing--diagnostic accuracy--electrocardiogram--electrocardiography--feature selection--heart disease--heart sound--human--monitoring--motivation--particle swarm optimization--restricted Boltzmann machine--sensitivity and specificity--Electrocardiography;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85171457557

Even though frequent patient monitoring is complex and expensive, analyzing chronic illness transitions and predicting patients at risk of developing ailments is crucial to healthcare. This paper proposes an innovative prediction framework for heterogeneous chronic disease prediction (HCDP), including hypertension (HT), heart disease (HD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD), and develops a patient symptom-weighted network (PSWN) by projecting the bipartite graph. Hence, PSWN represents the relationship between health conditions for patients with similar illnesses. LSTM was used to capture the temporal relationship between features in the patient network using a complex network theory. Finally, a deep extreme learning machine (DELM) was applied as a classifier to predict heterogeneous chronic disease. Subsequently, the proposed model was evaluated against previous studies, and the result revealed that the proposed model was more accurate. Remarkably, the proposed architecture achieves an accuracy of 95.02% for hypertension, 96.15% for heart disease, and 98.39% for chronic kidney disease prediction. The relevance of the model is also evaluated with the use of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. As evidenced in this study, the suggested model outperformed previous research and state-of-the-art approaches, suggesting its potential for a pivotal role in the medical decision-making of heterogeneous chronic diagnoses. Furthermore, the HCDP-DELM model contributes to healthcare authorities by establishing a system of smart surveillance and precise forecasting that allows for delayed disease detection and provides insightful potential strategies for developing effective healthcare. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.;Chronic kidney disease--Deep learning--Heart disease--Heterogeneous chronic disease--Hypertension--Knowledge-based prediction;Cardiology--Complex networks--Decision making--Diagnosis--Diseases--Health care--Knowledge acquisition--Learning systems--Long short-term memory--Patient monitoring--Chronic disease--Chronic kidney disease--Deep learning--Healthcare systems--Heart disease--Heterogeneous chronic disease--Hypertension--Knowledgebased predictions--Learning machines--Weighted networks--Forecasting;Elsevier B.V.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85181080457

The requirement for a centrally managed IoT-based infrastructure has limited scalability due to security problems with cloud computing. The fundamental factor is that health systems, such as health monitoring, etc., demand computational operations on large amounts of data, which leads to the sensitivity of device latency emerging during these systems. Fog computing is a novel approach to increasing the effectiveness of cloud computing by allowing the use of necessary resources and close to end users. Existing fog computing approaches still have several drawbacks, including the tendency to either overestimate reaction time or consider result correctness, but managing both at once compromises system compatibility. To focus on deep learning algorithms and automated monitoring, FETCH is a proposed framework that connects with edge computing devices. It provides a constructive framework for real-life healthcare systems, such as those treating heart disease and other conditions. The suggested fog-enabled cloud computing system uses FogBus, which exhibits benefits in terms of power consumption, communication bandwidth, oscillation, delay, execution duration, and correctness. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.;Deep learning(DL)--Edge computing--Fog computing--Healthcare--Heart disease analysis--Internet of Things (IoT)--Machine learning (ML);Cardiology--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Edge computing--Fog--Internet of things--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Cloud-computing--Deep learning--Disease analysis--Edge computing--Healthcare--Heart disease--Heart disease analyse--Internet of thing--Machine learning--Machine-learning--Fog computing;Springer Science and Business Media B.V.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85185540972

Since the heart is the body's most important organ, it is crucial to spot anomalies in its functioning. Many researchers have examined various automated categorization techniques for heart sounds, which has been a topic of interest for decades. Thanks to machine learning techniques, large datasets of heart sounds may now be automatically evaluated. Recent studies have used support vector machines, and neural networks to categorize heart sounds more accurately. The highest reported accuracy of 0.99 was attained by a Convolutional Neural Network-based model that utilized the short-time Fourier transform and Mel-frequency Cepstral coefficients as features. However, the worth of the input signal and the variation in heart sounds between people can have an impact on how accurate these algorithms are.

Since Deep Learning (DL) became popular, several DL methods have been developed for ECG classification. In this work, we compare how different methods for ECG signal representation perform in the multi-label classification of CVDs, including recent attention-based strategies. Furthermore, multimodal fusion strategies are employed to improve the prediction capacity of individual representation networks. The publicly available PTB-XL ECG dataset, which contains 21,837 records and labels for the diagnosis of 4 CVDs, was used for the task. Two DL strategies using different processing approaches were compared. Recurrent Neural Network-based models take advantage of the temporal dependence between raw signal values, namely through Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and 1D-Convolutional Neural Network models. Additionally, the raw ECG was converted into image representations, based on recent work, and the classification was performed using distinct 2D-Convolutional Neural Networks. The potential of multimodal DL was then studied through early, late and joint data fusion strategies, to evaluate the benefit of resorting to multiple representations. Results based on the 1D ECG representation outperform image-based approaches and multimodal models. The best model, GRU, achieved sensitivity and specificity of 79.67% and 81.04%, respectively. © 2024 The Author(s);Cardiovascular diseases--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Electrocardiogram classification--Multimodal artificial intelligence--Recurrent neural networks;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Data fusion--Diseases--Long short-term memory--Cardiovascular disease--Comparatives studies--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Electrocardiogram classification--Electrocardiogram signal--Learning methods--Multi-modal--Multi-modal fusion--Multimodal artificial intelligence--adolescent--adult--aged--Article--artificial neural network--back propagation--cardiovascular disease--child--comparative study--convolutional neural network--deep learning--diagnostic accuracy--electrocardiography--female--gated recurrent unit network--heart hypertrophy--heart infarction--heart muscle conduction disturbance--human--image segmentation--infant--major clinical study--male--multilabel classification--newborn--noise reduction--one dimensional convolutional neural network--outlier detection--prediction--recurrent neural network--sensitivity and specificity--short time Fourier transform--support vector machine--two dimensional convolutional neural network--Electrocardiograms;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85186547518

They are able to continuously acquire an ECG signal for long weeks and then increase the probability of detecting first brief, intermittent signs of the arrhythmia. However, the recorded signal is often broadly corrupted by noise and artifacts, and accurate assessment of its quality to avoid automated misdiagnosis and false alarms of AF is still an unsolved challenge. In this context, the present work is pioneer in exploring the usefulness of transforming the single-lead ECG signal into two common phase space (PS) representations, such as the Poincaré plot and the first order difference graph, for evaluation of its quality. Several machine and deep learning models fed with features and images derived from these PS portraits reported a better performance than well-known previous methods, even when they were trained and validated on two separate databases. Indeed, in binary classification of high- and low-quality ECG excerpts, the generated PS-based algorithms reported a discriminant power greater than 85%, misclassifying less than 20% of high-quality AF episodes and non-normal rhythms as noisy excerpts. Moreover, because both PS reconstructions do not require any mathematical transformation, these algorithms also spent much less time in classifying each ECG excerpt in validation and testing stages than previous methods. As a consequence, ECG transformation to both PS portraits enables novel, simple, effective, and computational low-cost techniques, based both on machine and deep learning classifiers, for ECG quality assessment. © 2023 The Author(s);Deep learning algorithms--Machine learning classifiers--Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation--Phase space portraits--Signal quality assessment;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Mathematical transformations--Phase space methods--Deep learning algorithm--Electrocardiogram signal--Learning classifiers--Machine learning classifier--Machine-learning--Paroxysmal atrial fibrillations--Phase space portrait--Phase spaces--Quality assessment--Signal quality assessment--adult--aged--Article--binary classification--classification algorithm--clinical article--controlled study--deep learning--electrocardiography--feature selection--female--human--machine learning--male--mathematical transformation--paroxysmal atrial fibrillation--quality control--Electrocardiograms;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85182025652

The methodology has been partitioned into two phases. Phase I acts towards the creation of a novel dataset as there was no data available for this particular problem statement. Phase II deals with the scope and application of the DRL algorithm on the above-invented dataset. The dataset formed is imbalanced in its essence. To effectively tackle the imbalanced dataset challenge, a cutting-edge imbalanced classification algorithm rooted in the power of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been embraced. The classification model has been drawn up as a Sequential Decision-Making procedure and is resolved by making use of the DRL algorithm viz Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN). A classification action is performed by an agent on a single sample at each time step. Classification actions are assessed by the environment, based on the assessment, a reward is given to an agent. In order to make the agent more responsive towards the minority class samples, rewards belonging to the minority class are higher. Under the supervision of this reward system, the agent finally learns the optimal classification policy for this imbalanced dataset problem. Comparative analysis of the DDQN algorithm with other Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms, including Dueling DQN, and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms has been performed in order to arrive at the best learning technique for the dataset. Furthermore, the DDQN algorithm has been evaluated against a selection of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. From the experimentation, it is demonstrated that the DDQN model outperformed other approaches with an accuracy of 99.99%, G-mean 0.9999, Recall 1.0000, and Specificity 0.9999. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd;Deep Reinforcement Learning--Heart-Failure--Pulmonary Embolism--Stroke Volume;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Decision making--Deep learning--Diseases--Heart--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Cause-effect relationships--Classification approach--Deep reinforcement learning--Heart failure--Imbalanced classification--Network algorithms--Pulmonary embolism--Reinforcement learning algorithms--Reinforcement learnings--Stroke volumes--Reinforcement learning;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85169808909

Because there is free access to healthcare information, researchers have developed methods to help with the heart disease diagnosis and prognosis. For such difficult illnesses, deep learning and machine learning models offer a reliable, quick, and efficient solution. The articles from Web of Science, EBSCO, and EMBASE that were released between 2009 and 2021 were chosen using PRISMA criteria. A successful search method was used to discover the research papers for this study that used AI-based learning techniques for heart disease prediction. There are 185 studies in all that conventional machine learning-based classifications and deep learning-based classifiers rank as having a significant impact on heart disease prediction. The survey also analysed the research done by various researchers and drew attention to the flaws in the earlier literature. Several metrics, including prediction rate, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, dice score, detection rate, area covered, precision, recall, and F1-score, were utilized to compare the findings. The solutions to the five scheduled investigations have been examined. Even though several of the methods suggested in the literature have excellent predicative accuracy, heart disease mortality has not decreased.

Then, with the help of machine learning algorithms, a heart disease risk estimation model was developed over two different size and structure data sets. The heart disease dataset, formed by combining 5 different heart disease datasets, was taken from the IEEE dataport website [1]. In order to eliminate noisy instances, the 12-variable data of 1190 patients was reduced to 836 instances by fuzzy rough set based instance selection method. Qualitative variables used in the analysis are age, sex, chest pain type, resting bps, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting ecg results, maximum heart rate, exercise induced angina, oldpeak, ST slope. Then, the data set was divided into two as 70% training and 30% test data sets, two-class averaged perceptron, two-class Bayes point machine, two-class logistic regression, two-class support vector machine, two-class neural network, two-class locally deep support vector machine and two-class boosted decision tree models were trained. As a result of the validity analysis carried out, the use of fuzzy rough set based instance selection method improved the prediction performance of all models. While the Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree method gave a higher accuracy than other methods, it gave an accuracy result between 89% and 93% in other methods. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;Fuzzy Rough Set--Heart Disease Risk--Instance Selection--Machine Learning;Cardiology--Decision trees--Diseases--Heart--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Logistic regression--Risk perception--Rough set theory--Statistical tests--Data set--Disease risks--Fuzzy-rough sets--Heart disease--Heart disease risk--Instance selection--Machine learning algorithms--Machine-learning--Rough-set based--Selection methods--Support vector machines;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85174633104

Methods and results: Using data from 9519 consecutive ED chest pain patients, we created ML models based on logistic regression or artificial neural networks. Model inputs included sex, age, ECG and the first blood tests at patient presentation: High sensitivity TnT (hs-cTnT), glucose, creatinine, and hemoglobin. For a safe rule-out, the models were adapted to achieve a sensitivity > 99% and a negative predictive value (NPV) > 99.5% for 30-day AMI/death. For rule-in, we set the models to achieve a specificity > 90% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of > 70%. The models were also compared with the 0 h arm of the European Society of Cardiology algorithm (ESC 0 h)--An initial hs-cTnT < 5 ng/L for rule-out and ≥ 52 ng/L for rule-in. A convolutional neural network was the best model and identified 55% of the patients for rule-out and 5.3% for rule-in, while maintaining the required sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV levels. ESC 0 h failed to reach these performance levels. Discussion: An ML model based on age, sex, ECG and blood tests at ED arrival can identify six out of ten chest pain patients for safe early rule-out or rule-in with no need for serial blood tests. Future studies should attempt to improve these ML models further, e.g. by including additional input data. © 2023, The Author(s).;Acute myocardial infarction--Chest pain--Deep learning--Emergency department--High-sensitivity troponin--Machine learning;Biomarkers--Chest Pain--Electrocardiography--Emergency Service, Hospital--Humans--Myocardial Infarction--Predictive Value of Tests--Prospective Studies--Troponin T--biological marker--troponin T--electrocardiography--heart infarction--hospital emergency service--human--predictive value--prospective study--thorax pain;BioMed Central Ltd;36732708;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85147318502

Existing machine learning and deep learning methods often yield suboptimal results in waveform delineation in the presence of noise. In this study, we propose a novel ECG signal delineation model, namely the Multi-Scale Channel Attention Convolutional Neural Network (MSCA-CNN). MSCA-CNN effectively captures multi-scale features using the MSCA-Block and enhances the discrimination of relevant components of ECG waveforms through channel attention mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce a domain-knowledge-based post-processing algorithm to eliminate misclassified data points. Experimental evaluation conducted on the publicly available database demonstrates the superior performance and robustness of MSCA-CNN compared to state-of-the-art methods. The reported average sensitivity and accuracy for various waveform onsets are 99.84% and 98.35%, respectively. Notably, MSCA-CNN accurately detects and delineates important features such as P-wave, QRS complex, and T-wave onsets even in the presence of noise.

In this context, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative tool in the healthcare sector, demonstrating a profound capability to discern intricate data patterns and furnish accurate prognostic assessments. The application of ML in cardiology is instrumental for risk prediction, early detection, and the customization of treatment protocols. The current study systematically reviews the spectrum of ML approaches applied to the prediction of heart disease, spanning supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, and transfer learning methodologies. Data from prominent repositories such as Kaggle and the UCI Machine Learning Repository were employed to evaluate the performance of various ML algorithms, with key metrics including accuracy, sensitivity, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). Influential predictors, namely age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle factors, were integral to the development of these predictive models. Particular attention was given to the exploration of ensemble methods and deep learning frameworks, which have shown to augment prediction accuracy beyond that of traditional models. This research delineates essential risk factors associated with heart disease and underscores the significance of predictive analytics in the healthcare landscape. With a focus on heterogeneous datasets and analytical techniques, the review aims to inform public health strategies and contribute to the alleviation of healthcare burdens. The elucidated findings highlight the promise of ML, particularly through the utilization of ensemble and deep learning methods, in the precursory prediction of heart disease.

Various segmentation approaches with demonstrated performance can be utilized for this task, but their robustness can suffer in the presence of noise. A noise-robust heart sound segmentation algorithm was developed and its accuracy was tested using two datasets: the CirCor DigiScope Phonocardiogram dataset and an in-house dataset - a heart murmur library collected at the Children's National Hospital (CNH). On the CirCor dataset, our segmentation algorithm marked the boundaries of the primary heart sounds S1 and S2 with an accuracy of 0.28 ms and 0.29 ms, respectively, and correctly identified the actual positive segments with a sensitivity of 97.44%. The algorithm also executed four times faster than a logistic regression hidden semi-Markov model. On the CNH dataset, the algorithm succeeded in 87.4% cases, achieving a 6% increase in segmentation success rate demonstrated by our original Shannon energy-based algorithm. Accurate heart sound segmentation is critical to supporting and accelerating AI research in cardiovascular diseases. The proposed algorithm increases the robustness of heart sound segmentation to noise and viability for clinical use.  © 2013 IEEE.;artificial intelligence--Auscultation--CirCor DigiScope phonocardiogram dataset--deep learning--heart murmur classification--heart sound segmentation--Shannon energy--stethoscope;Acoustic noise--Cardiology--Decision support systems--Deep learning--Diseases--Heart--Image segmentation--Markov processes--Phonocardiography--Auscultation--Circor digiscope phonocardiogram dataset--Classification algorithm--Deep learning--Energy--Heart beats--Heart Murmur--Heart murmur classification--Heart sound segmentation--Heart sounds--Noise robustness--Phonocardiograms--Recording--Shannon--Shannon energy--Sound segmentation--Stethoscope--Support vectors machine--Classification (of information);Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85182367422

Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the cornerstone form of examination in cardiology and are the most widely used diagnostic tool because they are widely available, inexpensive, and fast. Applications of AI to ECGs, especially deep learning (DL) methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been developed in many fields of cardiology in recent years. Deep learning methods provide valuable support for rapid ECG interpretation, demonstrating a diagnostic capability overlapping with specialists in the diagnosis of CVD by a classical analysis of macroscopic changes in the ECG trace. Through photoplethysmography, wearable devices can obtain single-derivative ECGs for the recognition of AI-diagnosed arrhythmias. In addition, CNNs have been developed that recognize no macroscopic electrocardiographic changes and can predict, from a 12-lead ECG, atrial fibrillation, even from sinus rhythm--left and right ventricular function--hypertrophic cardiomyopathy--acute coronary syndromes--or aortic stenosis. The fields of application are many, but numerous are the limitations, mainly associated with the reliability of the acquired data, an inability to verify black box processes, and medico-legal and ethical problems. The challenge of modern medicine is to recognize the limitations of AI and overcome them. © 2024 by the authors.;artificial intelligence--cardiovascular diseases--convolutional neural networks--deep learning--electrocardiogram;acute coronary syndrome--aortic valve stenosis--artificial intelligence--atrial fibrillation--cardiomyopathy--cardiovascular disease--convolutional neural network--deep learning--electrocardiogram--electrocardiography--electrolyte disturbance--heart infarction--heart left ventricle failure--human--hypertrophic cardiomyopathy--ischemic cardiomyopathy--machine learning--photoelectric plethysmography--Review;Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI);;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85187303206

Here, identifying heart disease in the early stage is essential for the patient's survival. While diagnosing heart disease with the ECG signal, it may cause an error due to the small amplitude variation. The highly accurate recognition process is the only option to save human lives. Initially, the gathered signals are decomposed using Adaptive DWT. Then, these decomposed signals are fed to the Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) features to get the first set of features. Secondly, the R-R interval is analyzed and taken from the gathered signals and subjected to a deep feature extraction stage, where the DCNN gets the second set of features from R-R intervals. Thirdly, QRS waves are analyzed from the gathered signals and given to the feature extraction stage, where the third set of features are gathered from QRS waves using DCNN. Finally, all these three sets of features are fused for processing heart disease detection, where the ERBF is utilized for getting the classified outcomes.

Patients with these conditions may require an artificially placed shunt to allow adequate circulation through the heart and lungs. Evaluating shunt function is paramount to sustain the functionality and life of the shunt. Effective monitoring of the shunt requires non-invasive approaches to enable frequent monitoring of the shunt&#x2019;s condition. In this work, we propose deep learning architectures for the classification of heart sounds associated with blood flow through shunts, obtained using a digital stethoscope from infants with ductal dependent physiology. Specifically, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory model for shunt type classification. Additionally, a Variational Autoencoder model utilizing latent space representation addresses five clinically relevant tasks: (1) Determining flow status during Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), (2) Discriminating flow patterns before and after shunt or pulmonary artery angioplasty, (3) Identifying cyanotic conditions versus non-cyanotic states, (4) Change of flow dynamics over time, and (5) Assessing flow status under elevated pulmonary artery pressure. Experimental results showcase the effectiveness of our approach, with the shunt type classification achieving an F1 score of 0.88 and an AUC of 0.95. For the remaining tasks (1)-(5), support vector machine, random forest, and k-nearest neighbors models are trained using the latent space representations, yielding AUC values of 0.77, 0.72, 0.85, 0.60, and 0.81, respectively. This development demonstrates that the acoustic signals captured via a stethoscope may contain valuable information for monitoring shunt flow changes in patients with CHD.

This study aims to use quantum learning to predict heart problems to increase the accuracy of traditional prediction and classification methods. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques need quantum learning to quickly and accurately analyze massive volumes of complex data. With quantum computing, the suggested DL and ML algorithms can change their predictions on the basis of changes in the dataset. This approach could help with the early and accurate detection of chronic diseases. The Cleveland heart disease dataset is undergoing preliminary processing to validate missing values to increase the precision rate and prevent incorrect forecasts. This study examined the feasibility of employing and deploying a quantum ML (QML) framework via cloud computing to categorize cardiac conditions. The research was divided into four sections. First, the principal component analysis was used to preprocess the Cleveland dataset, recursive feature elimination was used to select features, and min-max normalization was used to give the dataset a high-dimensional value. Second, we compared traditional classifiers, such as support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network, with the quantum approach to verify the quantum approach's efficiency. Third, we examined two unique QML classification methods: quantum neural networks (QNNs) and quantum SVM (QSVM). Fourth, bagging-QSVM was developed and deployed as an ensemble learning model. Experimental results using the QNN show an accuracy of 77%, a precision of 76%, a recall of 73%, and an F1 score of 75%. With an accuracy of 85%, a precision of 79%, a recall of 90%, and an F1-score of 84%, the QSVM method demonstrated a much better performance than the QNN. Particularly, the Bagging_QSVM model exhibited an outstanding performance, with a flawless score of 100% across all critical performance measures. The study shows that the bagging method for ensemble learning is a solid way of increasing the accuracy of quantum method predictions. © 2024 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.;bagging_QSVM--heart disease--machine learning--quantum machine learning--quantum support vector machines;Cardiology--Cloud computing--Deep learning--Diseases--Forecasting--Heart--Learning systems--Neural networks--Principal component analysis--Quantum computers--Bagging_quantum SVM--Cloud-computing--Heart disease--Machine-learning--Quantum machine learning--Quantum machines--Quantum neural networks--Quantum support vector machine--Support vectors machine--Support vector machines;Walter de Gruyter GmbH;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85190453403

Hence, the early detection of heart disease increases the survival rate. For an efficient detection of HD, a wide variety of techniques are used. But, the techniques rely on limited data--this degrades the accuracy and the performance of the model. So, to deal with these shortcomings, this paper has proposed Gaussian Kaiming Variance-based Deep Learning Neural Network (GKVDLNN) classifier for HD. In this study, the problem of heart disease detection using ECG and PCG signals is investigated, which provides valuable information about heart function. Thereby, the possible abnormalities of the heart are identified. Moreover, large data are used in this work to ensure the model’s accuracy. Firstly, from the publically accessible dataset, the input ECG along with PCG signals is gathered. Next, pre-processing is undergone by both signals. Utilizing Improved Empirical Mode Decomposition (IEMD), the signals are decomposed into bands after pre-processing. Then, for extracting the signal features, the decomposed bands are utilized. Then, for further process, the most suitable features are chosen as of the extracted features of both the ECG and PCG signals. After that, both the features are concatenated, and then classification is performed. In the classification process, the HD’s type is identified and classified by GKVDLNN. Experimental results stated the proposed model’s superiority and the proposed system withstands with 96.103% of accuracy with reduced costs. Overall, the method highlights the importance of early heart disease detection [32, 33] and provides a novel approach for achieving this goal through the integration of ECG and PCG signals with advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques [31]. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.;Chicken swarm optimization algorithm (CSOA)--Electrocardiography (ECG)--Empirical mode decomposition (EMD)--Feature extraction--Heart disease detection--Normalization--Phonocardiography (PCG);Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Feature extraction--Heart--Learning systems--Phonocardiography--Chicken swarm optimization algorithm--Disease detection--Electrocardiography--Empirical Mode Decomposition--Features extraction--Heart disease--Heart disease detection--Normalisation--Phonocardiography--Swarm optimization algorithms--Empirical mode decomposition;Springer;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85169894400

Timely diagnosis of MI is very crucial due to its high mortality rate, especially among older individuals. The existing manual MI diagnosis methods using the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal necessitate the availability of qualified medical professionals while also suffering from human errors and biases. To address this, recently many methods have been proposed to automate MI diagnosis, particularly using machine learning and deep learning. However, most of these methods often employ advanced deep learning architectures like CNN or RNN directly on raw ECG data and hence require considerable computational time and power. In contrast to this, the present paper introduces an innovative MI diagnosis method wherein the multi-lead ECG signal is uniquely modeled as a multivariate time series signal to extract the multivariate sequential features of the signal. These features are then combined with the proposed novel connectivity-based features of ECG signal that exploit the relational information among ECG leads. These combined features, which uniquely encode both the sequential and relational information of the multi-lead ECG data, are then provided to a simple logistic regression classifier for classification, thus reducing the model's computational complexity and time which is extremely important in timely detection of MI. Further, the most informative ECG leads for MI detection are identified to make the model even lighter. The state-of-the-art performance of the proposed integrated model on the PTB-XL dataset verified its efficacy in the MI diagnosis.  © 2013 IEEE.;connectivity--dynamic time warping--electrocardiogram--multivariate time series classification--Myocardial infarction--ROCKET;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Chemical detection--Classification (of information)--Deep learning--Feature extraction--Rockets--Time series analysis--Classification algorithm--Computational modelling--Connectivity--Dynamic time warping--Features extraction--Multivariate time series classifications--Myocardial Infarction--Myocardium--Time Warp--Time warp simulation--Time-series analysis--Electrocardiograms;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85182931711

A novel methodology for combining the valuable 3D and 3D + t shape information with the advantages of deep transfer learning is introduced. This method produces informative images from shape information, which are interpretable for deep CNNs previously trained using a large-scale image dataset. Methods: Our proposed structure can (1) generate 3D surfaces with optimal spatial resolution, (2) parametrize them using spherical harmonics shape descriptors (SPHARMs) with optimal frequency resolution, (3) employ registration to establish surface correspondences, and (4) convert the 3D corresponding point clouds to 2D images by spreading out the latitude and the longitude values of spherical components in the form of a flat coordinate system. The generated 2D images have the potential to feed into the pre-trained deep CNNs. The efficiency of the proposed method was assessed in myocardial infarction (MI) classification using two different datasets. Results: Five well-known CNN architectures as fixed feature extractors were evaluated. Deep features derived from the output of convolutional and pooling layers were fed into the SVM classifier. We also explored the feasibility of adding additional information by assigning a color to each RGB channel. Subsequently, EfficinetNet-b0 reached the best performance, with an accuracy of 97.92% ± 1.47 using colored images containing additional information, respectively. Conclusion: Our suggested approach by incorporating the transformed shape information and CNNs can be adopted as a robust computer-aided diagnosis system to assist clinicians in detecting various diseases such as MI. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd;Myocardial infarction--Shape classification--Shape models--Spherical harmonics shape descriptors--Transfer learning;Cardiology--Computer aided diagnosis--Deep learning--Harmonic analysis--Large dataset--Learning systems--Spheres--Support vector machines--2D images--Harmonic shapes--Myocardial Infarction--Shape classification--Shape descriptors--Shape information--Shape Modelling--Spherical harmonic shape descriptor--Spherical harmonics--Transfer learning--Classification (of information);Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85159635476

Heart or cardiac disease is one of the leading causes of human deaths. It is observed that cardiac arrest or cardiac disease mostly develop over time but are hard to discover due to the lack of knowledge and technology, mostly in developing countries. Even though these are preventable, the lack of experience and equipment is one of the leading factors for such a high death rate. In this study, we will discuss different practices used for the analysis of various heart diseases using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks, deep belief networks, long short-term memory, and others investigated by different researchers over the time span. The articles, for this study, were considered from 2018 to 2022 and after the screening, 63 articles were used for primary study. This systematic literature review on analysing heart diseases will help the future researchers to understand the pre-existing ML and DL practices in the healthcare industry. It gives an insight of the prominent techniques such as random forest, support vector machine, CNNs, decision tree, and so on. It also discusses the popular datasets used for the deployment of numerous diagnostic models. It also highlights the popular publishers along with journals and conferences from where the literature can be analysed. Further, it will help them in comprehending the existing open issues or challenges faced by the previous researchers.

Generally, an electrocardiogram (ECG) is a device used by a medical specialist to determine heart abnormalities or arrhythmias. The conventional classification approaches utilized a significant amount of time and attained only minimum accuracy. Thus, this work develops an effectual approach--named Chameleon-Sparrow Search Algorithm (CsSA) to train the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (Deep CNN) using ECG signals to classify arrhythmia. By utilizing the Daubechies wavelet filter, the pre-processing is done. Subsequently, wave components are detected by utilizing a multi-resolution wavelet-based model for eight-level decomposition employed for ECG signal. Then, features from DWT, auto-regressive, Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) features, and Variational mode decomposition (VMD) features are extracted. Moreover, Chameleon Swarm Algorithm is employed to filter representative features for arrhythmia diagnosis. Finally, the arrhythmia classification is progressed by proposed Chameleon-Sparrow Search approach-based Deep CNN (CsSA-based Deep CNN), where Deep CNN is trained by exploiting proposed CsSA. CsSA is proposed by collaboration of Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) and Chameleon Swarm Algorithm (CSA). The performance is estimated and compared with that of existing strategies regarding specificity, accuracy, and sensitivity. From analysis, it can be exhibited that CsSA-based Deep CNN obtains the highest value of accuracy, sensitivity, as well as specificity at a rate of 0.947, 0.929, and 0.964 respectively. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd;Classification--Deep CNN--Disease detection--ECG--Feature extraction--Signal;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Computer aided diagnosis--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep neural networks--Discrete wavelet transforms--Diseases--Feature extraction--Heart--Learning algorithms--Wavelet decomposition--Arrhythmia classification--Convolutional neural network--Deep convolutional neural network--Disease detection--Electrocardiogram signal--Features extraction--Optimisations--Search Algorithms--Signal--Swarm algorithms--algorithm--Article--chameleon swarm algorithm--classifier--computer assisted diagnosis--convolutional neural network--daubechies wavelet filter--deep learning--deep neural network--diagnostic accuracy--diagnostic test accuracy study--disease classification--electrocardiogram--empirical mode decomposition--evaluation study--feature extraction--feature selection--heart arrhythmia--human--P wave--PR interval--Q wave--QT interval--receiver operating characteristic--RR interval--S wave amplitude--sensitivity and specificity--signal processing--sparrow search algorithm--support vector machine--T wave--variational mode decomposition--wavelet transform--Electrocardiograms;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85184773982

The early prediction and evaluation of this problem are essential to avoid atrial fibrillation, heart valve disease, and other cardiac disorders. Different clinical strategies like Computerized tomography (CT) scans, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and Carotid (ka-ROT-id) ultrasound are available to diagnose this problem. However, these methods are time-consuming and expensive. Wearable devices based on photoplethysmography (PPG) are gaining prevalence in diagnosing various cardiovascular diseases. This work uses the PPG signal to classify the CI subjects from the normal. We propose an automated framework and fiducial point-independent approach to predict CI with sufficient accuracy. The experiment is performed with a publicly available database having PPG and other physiological data of 219 individuals. The best validation and test accuracy of 91.8% and 91.3% are obtained after diagnosis with Coarse Gaussian SVM. The proposed work aims to extract cerebral infarction pathology by extracting relevant entropy features from higher order PPG derivatives for the prediction of CI and offers a simple, automated and inexpensive approach for early detection of CI and promotes awareness for the subjects to undergo further treatment to avoid major disorders. © Korean Society of Medical and Biological Engineering 2023.;APPG--CI--Entropy--JPPG--Prediction--Sensor signal processing;Automation--Biomedical signal processing--Brain--Cardiology--Computerized tomography--Diagnosis--Diseases--Entropy--Magnetic resonance imaging--Ultrasonic applications--APPG--Blood supply--Brain cells--Cerebral infarction--Cognitive impairment--JPPG--Sensor signal processing--Sensor signals--Sensors data--Signal-processing--accuracy--adult--aged--aging--algorithm--Article--attention--attention entropy--automated framework--awareness--body mass--brain infarction--cardiovascular disease--carotid ultrasound--cerebrovascular accident--computer assisted tomography--conceptual framework--confusion matrix--deep neural network--demographics--discrete wavelet transform--dispersion--dispersion entropy--early diagnosis--early screening--entropy--extraction--heart rate--human--hypertension--machine learning--monitoring--nuclear magnetic resonance imaging--pathology--photoelectric plethysmography--prediction--prevalence--sensor signal processing--Shannon index--signal noise ratio--signal processing--slope entropy--support vector machine--validation process--very elderly--Forecasting;Springer Verlag;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85174242407

Traditionally, researchers have relied on structured data, including demographic information, vital signs, laboratory results, and medication records. However, the widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has introduced a substantial amount of unstructured information in the form of clinical notes, which have been largely underutilized. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for extracting valuable insights from these clinical notes and incorporating them into machine learning frameworks. Additionally, multimodal machine learning, which integrates structured and unstructured data, has gained considerable attention to enhance the accuracy of adverse event prediction. This research focuses on the application of multimodal machine learning for predicting adverse events such as atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and ischemic myocardial infarction. The study aims to compare the performance of a Machine Learning specialist without domain knowledge would obtain with an approach guided by physicians, that includes an information retrieval step using unstructured clinical notes.

Prompt diagnosis and early intervention are essential for improving a patient’s survival chances. Electrocardiography (ECG) is the most commonly used diagnostic method for MI, but other noninvasive imaging techniques and clinical parameters are also used. However, manual interpretation of these methods can result in potential inconsistencies among different observers. To address this issue, automated computer-aided diagnostic systems that utilize artificial intelligence (AI) have been developed. These systems use both machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to discriminate between MI and normal signals or subjects. In this review paper, we survey the current state-of-the-art methods in ML and DL-based MI detection approaches that are published from 2015 to the present. This review highlights the advantages and limitations of different AI-based approaches and provides insights into future directions for research in this field. The ultimate goal of these efforts is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of MI diagnosis and contribute to more efficient and timely diagnosis of MI patients. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.;Artificial intelligence--Automated computer-aided diagnostic systems--Coronary artery disease--Myocardial infarction--Noninvasive imaging techniques;Cardiology--Computer aided diagnosis--Deep learning--Diseases--Learning systems--Patient treatment--Automated computer-aided diagnostic system--Computer aided diagnostics--Coronary artery disease--Diagnostic systems--Heart attack--Machine-learning--Modern techniques--Myocardial Infarction--Non-invasive imaging--Noninvasive imaging technique--Electrocardiography;Springer;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85173988363

Current ECG-based diagnosis systems show promising performance owing to the rapid development of deep learning techniques. However, the label scarcity problem, the co-occurrence of multiple CVDs and the poor performance on unseen datasets greatly hinder the widespread application of deep learning-based models. Addressing them in a unified framework remains a significant challenge. To this end, we propose a multi-label semi-supervised model (ECGMatch) to recognize multiple CVDs simultaneously with limited supervision. In the ECGMatch, an ECGAugment module is developed for weak and strong ECG data augmentation, which generates diverse samples for model training. Subsequently, a hyperparameter-efficient framework with neighbor agreement modeling and knowledge distillation is designed for pseudo-label generation and refinement, which mitigates the label scarcity problem. Finally, a label correlation alignment module is proposed to capture the co-occurrence information of different CVDs within labeled samples and propagate this information to unlabeled samples. Extensive experiments on four datasets and three protocols demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed model, especially on unseen datasets. As such, this model can pave the way for diagnostic systems that achieve robust performance on multi-label CVDs prediction with limited supervision. © 1979-2012 IEEE.;Cardiovascular diseases--electrocardiograph--multi-label learning--semi-supervised learning;Algorithms--Cardiovascular Diseases--Electrocardiography--Humans--Supervised Machine Learning--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Distillation--Forecasting--Learning algorithms--Supervised learning--'current--Cardiovascular disease--Correlation--Deep learning--Electrocardiograph--Multi-label learning--Multi-labels--Predictive models--Semi-supervised learning--algorithm--cardiovascular disease--diagnostic imaging--electrocardiography--human--supervised machine learning--Electrocardiography;IEEE Computer Society;38096090;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85180306234

The electrocardiogram (ECG) plays a crucial role in CVD diagnosis, prognosis, and prevention--however, different challenges still remain, such as an increasing unmet demand for skilled cardiologists capable of accurately interpreting ECG. This leads to higher workload and potential diagnostic inaccuracies. Data-driven approaches, such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have emerged to improve existing computer-assisted solutions and enhance physicians’ ECG interpretation of the complex mechanisms underlying CVD. However, many ML and DL models used to detect ECG-based CVD suffer from a lack of explainability, bias, as well as ethical, legal, and societal implications (ELSI). Despite the critical importance of these Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) aspects, there is a lack of comprehensive literature reviews that examine the current trends in ECG-based solutions for CVD diagnosis or prognosis that use ML and DL models and address the Trustworthy AI requirements. This review aims to bridge this knowledge gap by providing a systematic review to undertake a holistic analysis across multiple dimensions of these data-driven models such as type of CVD addressed, dataset characteristics, data input modalities, ML and DL algorithms (with a focus on DL), and aspects of Trustworthy AI like explainability, bias and ethical considerations. Additionally, within the analyzed dimensions, various challenges are identified. To these, we provide concrete recommendations, equipping other researchers with valuable insights to understand the current state of the field comprehensively. © 2024 The Authors;Bias--Cardiovascular diseases (CVD)--Deep learning--ECG--Ethical, Legal and societal implications (ELSI)--Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)--Machine learning--Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence;Artificial Intelligence--Cardiovascular Diseases--Electrocardiography--Humans--Machine Learning--Quality of Life--Cardiology--Computer aided analysis--Computer aided instruction--Deep learning--Diseases--Learning systems--Philosophical aspects--Bias--Cardiovascular disease--Deep learning--Ethical implications--Ethical, legal and societal implication--Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)--Legal implications--Machine-learning--Societal implications--Trustworthy artificial intelligence--arterial pressure--artificial neural network--cardiac imaging--cardiovascular disease--cardiovascular mortality--cerebrovascular accident--computer assisted tomography--convolutional neural network--coronary artery disease--deep learning--echocardiography--electrocardiogram--gate recurrent unit network--heart arrhythmia--heart ejection fraction--heart failure--heart hypertrophy--heart infarction--heart muscle conduction disturbance--human--hypertension--learning algorithm--long short term memory network--machine learning--multilayer perceptron--nuclear magnetic resonance imaging--photoelectric plethysmography--physical activity--predictive model--Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses--recurrent neural network--Review--ST segment--support vector machine--systematic review--T wave--transfer of learning--wellbeing--artificial intelligence--cardiovascular disease--electrocardiography--quality of life--Electrocardiograms;Elsevier Ltd;38460311;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85187198306

The computerized identification and tracking of irregularities from multi-lead electrocardiograms (MECGs) is a common pattern recognition issue that has been studied in recent years. Ubiquity and feature minimization are the key challenges. The main objective of the proposed study is to demonstrate increased classification precision for myocardial infarction (MI) identification from MECG by fusing a support vector machine (SVM) with a deep autoencoder (DAE). The validation of the suggested method was conducted with 100 numbers of ECG signal/data from Physionet, including three major classes (anterior, inferior and posterior) of myocardial infarction (MI). Both the normal and MI ECG beats were fed to feature extraction tool as input and a minimized set of 60 output attributes (/features) was fed to the binary classifier. This proposed classification method used ten-fold cross validation. The proposed classification technique achieved 97.3% and 97.12% of average sensitivity and positive predictivity respectively. The result of the proposed method is compared with other existing classification technique in terms of features and the sensitivity and data length.  © 2024 IEEE.;deep autoencoder--Electrocardiogram--feature extraction--Myocardial Infarction classification--support vector machine;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Deep learning--Extraction--Feature extraction--Learning systems--Risk assessment--Support vector machines--Analysis techniques--Auto encoders--Classification technique--Deep autoencoder--Electrocardiogram analysis--Features extraction--Learning approach--Myocardial Infarction--Myocardial infarction classification--Support vectors machine--Electrocardiograms;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85190939821

The field of medicine may significantly benefit from prediction systems using artificial intelligence techniques by making the disease prediction more accurate and faster. This paper aims to improve the predictive performance of cardiac disease diagnosis through the use of the case-based reasoning (CBR) approach, specifically focusing on its two phases: retrieval and reuse. Additionally, we aim to optimize the selection of attributes in cardiac dataset by using the Boruta method. Our approach uses various models including machine learning and deep learning models, in addition to hybrid models in the retrieval phase to accurately predict the presence or absence of a cardiac disease among patients. A robust reuse measure is used to verify the validity of the retrieved solutions and determine the necessity of applying the reuse algorithm. The results showed a significant improvement in predictive precision, with the highest accuracy achieved by the hybrid 1D CNN-SVM model on cardiac datasets. The effectiveness of the suggested approach is discussed by comparing the results with different search methods.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.;Boruta algorithm--Case-based reasoning--prediction of heart disease--retrieval phase--reuse-guided retrieval phase--stratified k -fold cross-validation;Cardiology--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Forecasting--Heart--Borutum algorithm--Cardiac disease--Casebased reasonings (CBR)--Heart disease--K fold cross validations--Prediction of heart disease--Retrieval phase--Reuse--Reuse-guided retrieval phase--Stratified k-fold cross-validation--Case based reasoning;World Scientific;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85178411272

Its early diagnosis can mitigate the extent of myocardial damage by facilitating early therapeutic interventions. The regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA) of the ischemic myocardial segments is the earliest change to set in that can be captured by echocardiography. However, assessing the motion only from a single echocardiography view may lead to missing the diagnosis of MI as the RWMA may not be visible on that specific view. Therefore, in this study, we propose to fuse apical 4-chamber (A4C) and apical 2-chamber (A2C) views in which a total of 12 myocardial segments can be analyzed for MI detection. The proposed method first estimates the motion of the left ventricle wall by Active Polynomials (APs), which extract and track the endocardial boundary to compute myocardial segment displacements. The features are extracted from the displacements, which are concatenated and fed into the classifiers to detect MI. The main contributions of this study are (1) creation of a new benchmark dataset by including both A4C and A2C views in a total of 260 echocardiography recordings, which is publicly shared with the research community, (2) improving the performance of the prior work of threshold-based APs by a machine learning based approach, and (3) a pioneer MI detection approach via multi-view echocardiography by fusing the information of A4C and A2C views. The proposed method achieves 90.91% sensitivity and 86.36% precision for MI detection over multi-view echocardiography.

You need to know about your heart condition to overcome this disease appropriately. An electronic stethoscope is used in the cardiac auscultation technique to listen to and analyze heart sounds. Several pathologic cardiac diseases can be detected by auscultation of the heart sounds. Unlike heart murmurs, the sounds of the heart are separate--brief auditory phenomena usually originate from a single source. This article proposes a deep-learning model for predicting cardiovascular disease. The combined deep learning model uses the MFCC and LSTM for feature extraction and prediction of cardiovascular disease. The model achieved an accuracy of 94.3%.

Many conventional methods have taken efforts on earlier prediction but faced with challenges of higher prediction cost, extended time for computation and complexities with larger volume of data which reduced prediction accuracy. In order to overcome such pitfalls, AI (Artificial Intelligence) technology has been evolved in diagnosing heart diseases through deployment of several ML (Machine Learning) and DL (Deep Learning) algorithms. It improves detection by influencing with its capacity of learning from the massive data containing age, obesity, hypertension and other risk factors of patients and extract it accordingly to differentiate on the circumstances. Moreover, storage of larger data with AI greatly assists in analysing the occurrence of the disease from past historical data. Hence, this paper intends to provide a review on different AI based algorithms used in the heart disease prognostication and delivers its benefits through researching on various existing works. It performs comparative analysis and critical assessment as encompassing accuracies and maximum utilization of algorithms focussed by traditional studies in this area. The major findings of the paper emphasized on the evolution and continuous explorations of AI techniques for heart disease prediction and the future researchers aims in determining the dimensions that have attained high and low prediction accuracies on which appropriate research works can be performed. Finally, future research is included to offer new stimulus for further investigation of AI in cardiac disease diagnosis. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;artificial intelligence--deep learning--Heart disease--machine learning--prediction;Artificial heart--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Digital storage--Diseases--Heart--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Artificial intelligence algorithms--Artificial intelligence technologies--Conventional methods--Deep learning--Early prediction--Heart disease--Large volumes--Machine-learning--Prediction accuracy--Prediction of heart disease--Forecasting;Taylor and Francis Ltd.;38424704;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85186442108

Using historical Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to forecast the risk of critical events in heart failure (HF) patients is an important area of research in the field of personalized medicine. However, it is difficult for some machine learning models to predict the risk of critical events owing to data imbalance and poor feature performance in the EHR data of HF patients. While time series-based deep neural networks have achieved excellent results, they lack interpretability. To solve these problems, this study focuses on proposing a deep neural network prediction model of critical events in heart failure patients based on Contrastive learning and Attention mechanism (CLANet). We evaluate our model on a real-world medical dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that CLANet improves by 2–10 % over the conventional methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2024.;Contrastive learning--Critical event prediction--Electronic Health Records--Heart failure;Cardiology--Deep neural networks--E-learning--Forecasting--Health risks--Learning systems--Records management--Clinical syndromes--Contrastive learning--Critical event prediction--Critical events--Electronic health--Electronic health record--Event prediction--Health records--Heart failure--Prediction modelling--Heart;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85181976107

It is one of the illnesses with the highest mortality rate. Its fatality rate results in nearly 17 million deaths worldwide. Given the daily increase in heart disease cases, predicting any disease early is critical and concerning. Early detection of heart disease is a difficult task that must be accomplished carefully and effectively by gathering precise information about the patient who is at risk for heart disease. To predict whether a person has cardiac disease, there are numerous AI-based (Machine/Deep learning) Models available considering medical characteristics (features) of heart disease. By comparing and contrasting several machine learning classifiers, this paper proposed a heart disease prediction system. This system will aid in identifying and predicting whether the patient is likely to have or be diagnosed with heart disease based on his or her current medical state. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.;Heart Disease Prediction--K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithms--Logistic Regression--Machine Learning;Cardiology--Diagnosis--Diseases--Heart--Logistic regression--Machine learning--Nearest neighbor search--Cardiovascular disease--Heart disease--Heart disease diagnosis--Heart disease prediction--K-near neighbor algorithm--Learning classifiers--Logistics regressions--Machine-learning--Mortality rate--Nearest-neighbor algorithms--Forecasting;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85190412794

Here we aimed to develop a deep-learning based algorithm that incorporates pressure waveforms for the identification and risk stratification of patients with HF. The first study, with a case–control study design to address data imbalance issue, included 431 subjects with HF exhibiting typical symptoms and 1545 control participants with no history of HF (non-HF). Carotid pressure waveforms were obtained from all the participants using applanation tonometry. The HF score, representing the probability of HF, was derived from a one-dimensional deep neural network (DNN) model trained with characteristics of the normalized carotid pressure waveform. In the second study of HF patients, we constructed a Cox regression model with 83 candidate clinical variables along with the HF score to predict the risk of all-cause mortality along with rehospitalization. To identify subjects using the HF score, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1 score, and area under receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.867, 0.851, 0.874, 0.878, and 0.93, respectively, from the hold-out cross-validation of the DNN, which was better than other machine learning models, including logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest. With a median follow-up of 5.8 years, the multivariable Cox model using the HF score and other clinical variables outperformed the other HF risk prediction models with concordance index of 0.71, in which only the HF score and five clinical variables were independent significant predictors (p < 0.05), including age, history of percutaneous coronary intervention, concentration of sodium in the emergency room, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and hemoglobin. Our study demonstrated the diagnostic and prognostic utility of arterial waveforms in subjects with HF using a DNN model. Pulse wave contains valuable information that can benefit the clinical care of patients with HF. © The Author(s) 2024.;Deep learning--Heart failure--Pressure waveform--Pulse wave analysis;Cardiology--Diagnosis--Forecasting--Forestry--Heart--Learning systems--Logistic regression--Neural network models--Random forests--Risk assessment--Support vector machines--Arterial pulsation--Deep learning--Heart failure--Hemodynamic parameters--Learning-based algorithms--Long-term outcome--Neural network model--Pressure waveforms--Pulse wave analysis--Risk stratification--Deep neural networks;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;38361179;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85185252918

Although coronary angiography is the most precise diagnostic method, its discomfort and cost often deter patients, particularly in the disease's initial stages. Hence, there is a pressing need for a non-invasive and dependable diagnostic approach. In the contemporary era, machine learning has pervaded various aspects of human life, playing a significant role in revolutionizing the healthcare industry. Decision support systems based on machine learning, leveraging a patient's clinical parameters, offer a promising avenue for diagnosing heart disease. Early detection remains pivotal in mitigating the severity of heart disease. The healthcare sector generates vast amounts of patient and disease-related data daily. Unfortunately, practitioners frequently underutilize this valuable resource. To tap into the potential of this data for more precise heart disease diagnoses, a range of machine learning algorithms is available. Given the extensive research on automated heart disease detection systems, there is a need to synthesize this knowledge. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent research on heart disease diagnosis by reviewing articles published by reputable sources between 2014 and 2022. It identifies challenges faced by researchers and proposes potential solutions. Additionally, the paper suggests directions for expanding upon existing research in this critical field. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Center for Numerical Methods in Engineering (CIMNE) 2024.;;Cardiology--Decision support systems--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Health care--Heart--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Numerical methods--Taps--Coronary angiography--Diagnostic approach--Diagnostic methods--Disease classification--Heart disease--Heart disease diagnosis--Learning techniques--Machine-learning--Precise diagnostics--Pressung--Diseases;Springer Science and Business Media B.V.;;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85186416870

Thus, some machine learning methods are developed to detect coronary artery disease (CAD) based on phonocardiogram (PCG). However, current methods lack sufficient clinical dataset and fail to achieve efficient feature utilization. Besides, the methods require complex processing steps including empirical feature extraction and classifier design. To achieve efficient CAD detection, we propose the multiscale attention convolutional compression network (MACCN) based on clinical PCG dataset. Firstly, PCG dataset including 102 CAD subjects and 82 non-CAD subjects was established. Then, a multiscale convolution structure was developed to catch comprehensive heart sound features and a channel attention module was developed to enhance key features in multiscale attention convolutional block (MACB). Finally, a separate downsampling block was proposed to reduce feature losses. MACCN combining the blocks can automatically extract features without empirical and manual feature selection. It obtains good classification results with accuracy 93.43%, sensitivity 93.44%, precision 93.48%, and F1 score 93.42%. The study implies that MACCN performs effective PCG feature mining aiming for CAD detection. Further, it integrates feature extraction and classification and provides a simplified PCG processing case.  © 2013 IEEE.;attention module--convolution attention neural network--coronary artery disease--Heart sounds;Coronary Artery Disease--Data Compression--Heart Sounds--Humans--Machine Learning--Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Computer aided diagnosis--Convolution--Data mining--Diseases--Extraction--Feature extraction--Learning systems--Phonocardiography--Artery--Attention module--Convolution attention neural network--Coronary artery disease--Disease detection--Features extraction--Heart sounds--Neural-networks--Phonocardiograms--Solid modelling--ablation therapy--aged--Article--artificial neural network--classification algorithm--controlled study--convolutional neural network--coronary angiography--coronary artery disease--data processing--deep learning--diagnostic accuracy--diagnostic test accuracy study--disease classification--feature extraction--feature selection--female--global average pooling--global maximum pooling--heart sound--hidden Markov model--human--image processing--image segmentation--machine learning--major clinical study--male--mathematical analysis--multiscale attention convolutional block--multiscale attention convolutional compression network--phonocardiography--receptive field--recurrent neural network--sensitivity and specificity--spectral density--transfer of learning--coronary artery disease--data compression--diagnostic imaging--heart sound--Heart;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;38227404;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85182935131

According to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), 26 million people worldwide have heart disease, with 3.6 million diagnosed each year. Early detection of heart disease will aid in lowering the mortality rate. The lack of diversity in training data and the difficulty in comprehending the findings of complicated AI models are the key issues in current research for heart disease prediction using artificial intelligence. To overcome this, in this paper, cardiac disease prediction using AI algorithms with SelectKBest has been proposed. Features are standardized, balanced, and selected using the StandardScaler, SMOTE, and SelectKBest techniques. Machine learning models such as support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor(KNN), decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), adaptive boosting (AB), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), and extra tree (ET) and deep learning models such as vanilla long short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM), stacked long short-term memory (LSTM), and deep neural network (DNN) are assessed using Alizadeh Sani, combined (Cleveland, Hungarian, Switzerland, Long Beach VA, and Stalog), and Pakistan heart failure datasets. As a result of the evaluation, the proposed deep neural network (DNN) with SelectKBest predicted heart disease in a promising way. The prediction rate of unweighted accuracy of 99% on Alizadeh Sani, 98% on combined, and 97% on Pakistan are gained in tenfold cross-validation experiments. The suggested approach can be utilized to diagnose heart disease in its early stages.

So that identifying heart related diseases accurately and in time may save the patients life’s and increases the chances of survival. However, manual approaches for identifying heart disease suffer from biases and variations between examiners. We can use various machine learning algorithms to overcome these issues in manual approaches These ML algorithms provide more accurate and efficient tools for identifying and analysing the patients with heart disease. To explore the potential of machine learning algorithms, the recommended study employed various techniques to identify and predict human heart disease using a comprehensive heart disease dataset. Sensitivity, specificity, F-measure and accuracy in classification can be used to examine the performance. We have used eight machine learning classifiers such as Ada boost, Extreme Gradient Boosting including Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminate Analysis, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine. The results demonstrated notable improvements in the prediction classifiers’ accuracy. This underscores the efficiency of machine learning algorithms in finding and predicting human heart disease.

Since they primarily depend on single domain feature information and tend to focus equally on each part of the signal rather than employing a selective attention mechanism. In addition, they fail to exploit convolutional neural network (CNN) - based features with an effective fusion strategy. Methods: In order to overcome these limitations, a novel multimodal attention convolutional neural network (MACNN) with a feature-level fusion strategy, in which Mel-cepstral domain as well as general frequency domain features are incorporated to increase the diversity of the features, is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method, DilationAttenNet is first utilized to construct attention-based CNN feature extractors and then these feature extractors are jointly optimized in MACNN at the feature-level. The attention mechanism aims to suppress irrelevant information and focus on crucial diverse features extracted from the CNN. Results: Extensive experiments are carried out to study the efficacy of the feature level fusion in comparison to that with early fusion. The results show that the proposed MACNN method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy and score for the two publicly available Github and Physionet datasets.

ECG is an electrical measurement that captures cardiac actions and is the gold standard for identifying CVD. But, ECG cannot be used for continuous cardiac monitoring because of its necessity for user participation. PPG is an optically attained signal for detecting blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissues. Deep learning (DL) methods have shown remarkable performance in predicting and detecting CVD disease using PPG signals. Therefore, this study designs a new Cardiovascular Risk Detection using Harris Hawks Optimization with Ensemble Learning (CRDHHO-EL) model on PPG Signals. The presented CRDHHO-EL technique examines the PPG signals to identify the risks of cardiovascular diseases. To accomplish this, the CRDHHO-EL technique uses an ensemble of three classifiers, namely deep belief network (DBN), deep auto-encoder (DAE), and extreme learning machine (ELM) models. Moreover, the HHO algorithm is used for adjusting the hyperparameter values of the classifier models, boosting overall performance. The experimental result analysis of the CRDHHO-EL on the open-access dataset showcases the significant performance of the CRDHHO-EL technique over other existing approaches. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.;Cardiovascular disease--Computer aided detection--Deep auto-encoder--Deep learning--PPG signals;Biomedical engineering--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Signal detection--Signal encoding--Auto encoders--Cardiovascular disease--Cardiovascular risk--Computer aided detection--Deep auto-encoder--Deep learning--Ensemble learning--Optimisations--Photoplethysmography signal--Risk detections--Learning systems;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85165448412

For this purpose, the paper will present the use of Artificial Intelligence technology - MLP learning artificial neural network - to determine the optimal time in the diagnosis/prognosis of myocardial infarction. The myocardial infarction database used to train the network corresponding to time points on admission, at 24 h and 48 h after admission, were obtained from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and preprocessed. Based on this database, 3 MLP neural networks corresponding to the 3-time points mentioned above were developed using the Deep Learning Toolbox of MATLAB software. The comparison of the results of training these networks showed that the time when predicting the risk of myocardial infarction after 24 h of hospital admission was the most accurate. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG. 2024.;Artificial Neuron Networks (ANN)--Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)--Myocardial Infarction (MI) Database;Cardiology--Deep learning--Health risks--MATLAB--Multilayer neural networks--Timing circuits--Artificial intelligence technologies--Artificial neuron network--Artificial neuron networks--Multilayer perceptron--Multilayers perceptrons--Myocardial Infarction--Myocardial infarction  database--Optimal timing--Perceptron learning--Time points--Database systems;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85176009304

Cardiovascular disease is the most common vascular disorder contributing to heart-related issues. Critical factors impacting cardiovascular health include blood pressure, glucose control, and cholesterol management. The escalating mortality rates associated with heart disease underscore the urgency for precise and secure diagnoses to facilitate timely intervention and prevention. Incorrect diagnoses of cardiovascular disease can have devastating consequences, highlighting the critical need for accurate assessments. In this study, we introduce an intelligent system for heart disease prediction based on the integration of the ACLS-RCNN and ICSOA techniques. The workflow begins with the collection and preprocessing of patient information. Data preprocessing focuses on addressing missing values, employing IQR-RS scaling, and handling imbalanced data using the ROS technique. Next, features are extracted from the pre-processed data utilizing kernel-based linear discriminate analysis. To reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, hybrid optimization (CI-AO + GI-SMO) is employed to select informative attributes. Disease prognoses are then generated through the application of the ACLS-RCNN model, with further enhancement achieved by the Improved Cuttlefish-Swarm Optimisation Algorithm (ICSOA). Through extensive Python-based simulations, we evaluate the recommended system's performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score, comparing it against established methodologies. Our software demonstrates remarkable accuracy in clinical data prediction and diagnosis, offering a promising tool for enhancing heart disease prognosis and early detection. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd;Adaptive cross-layer stacked residual convolutional neural networks (ACLS-RCNN) enhanced cuttlefish swarm optimisation (ICSOA)--Heart disease--Kernel-based linear discriminant analysis;Blood pressure--Cardiology--Computer software--Convolution--Data handling--Diagnosis--Discriminant analysis--Heart--Multilayer neural networks--Optimization--Adaptive cross layers--Adaptive cross-layer stacked residual convolutional neural network  enhanced cuttlefish swarm optimization (improved cuttlefish-swarm optimization algorithm)--Cardiovascular disease--Convolutional neural network--Heart disease--Hybrid optimization algorithm--Kernel-based linear discriminant analyse--Linear discriminant analyze--Swarm optimization--Swarm optimization algorithms--advanced cardiac life support--algorithm--Article--chromatophore--controlled study--convolutional neural network--deep learning--diagnostic accuracy--dimensionality reduction--discriminant analysis--echocardiography--entropy--feature extraction--feature learning (machine learning)--feature selection--heart disease--heart rhythm--human--image processing--image retrieval--major clinical study--measurement accuracy--measurement precision--mortality rate--patient information--prediction--process optimization--prognosis--workflow--Intelligent systems;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85173271931

Given its recurring and often asymptomatic nature, there is the need for continuous monitoring using wearable devices. This paper proposes a single-microcontroller-based system designed for the automatic detection of MI based on the Edge Computing paradigm. Two solutions for MI detection are evaluated, based on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. The developed algorithms are based on two different approaches currently available in the literature, and they are optimized for deployment on low-resource hardware. A feasibility assessment of their implementation on a single 32-bit microcontroller with an ARM Cortex-M4 core was examined, and a comparison in terms of accuracy, inference time, and memory usage was detailed. For ML techniques, significant data processing for feature extraction, coupled with a simpler Neural Network (NN) is involved. On the other hand, the second method, based on DL, employs a Spectrogram Analysis for feature extraction and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a longer inference time and higher memory utilization. Both methods employ the same low power hardware reaching an accuracy of 89.40% and 94.76%, respectively. The final prototype is an energy-efficient system capable of real-time detection of MI without the need to connect to remote servers or the cloud. All processing is performed at the edge, enabling NN inference on the same microcontroller. © 2024 by the authors.;deep learning--edge computing--machine learning--myocardial infarction detection;Cardiology--Computer hardware--Controllers--Convolutional neural networks--Data handling--Deep learning--Edge computing--Energy efficiency--Extraction--Feature extraction--Learning systems--Deep learning--Detection approach--Edge computing--Features extraction--Machine-learning--Microcontroller-based--Myocardial Infarction--Myocardial infarction detection--Neural-networks--Real- time--Microcontrollers;Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI);38339545;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85184656140

This can lead to congestive heart failure. The life expectancy of a congestive heart failure patients can vary depending on factors such as disease severity, age, genetics, and other variables. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that almost half of the patients with congestive heart failure survive for more than five years. Previous studies have attempted to predict the survival rate of heart failure patients, but most of them have been limited by unbalanced data sets and a small number of examples. The main goal of this research is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the survival status of heart failure patients while providing an insight into its decision-making process. Machine learning algorithms are a part of artificial intelligence systems and can be used to predict output values based on input data. However, Many machine learning models lack an explanation of how they arrive at their decisions. Therefore, explainable machine learning algorithms are now being used to understand and explain the decision-making process of machine learning models. In this research, we not only use the latest machine learning algorithms for prediction, but we also incorporate explainability features to understand the results. Hyper-parameter optimization techniques are employed to find the best parameter values for better predictive accuracy. Our data set consists of 1334 heart failure patients’ data collected from Felege Hiwot referral hospital and Injibara general hospital. The prediction models used include Decision Tree, Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Deep Neural Network, and XGBoost. Prior to conducting the actual experiment, the data set is balanced using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). Experimental findings indicate that XGBoost performs better than other machine learning techniques, achieving an AUC value of 0.93 using Grid Search HPO after SMOTE. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.;Follow-up Period--Heart Failure--Hyper-parameter Optimization--Model Explainability--Survival Event--Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique;Cardiology--Decision trees--Deep neural networks--Disease control--Forecasting--Hospitals--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Nearest neighbor search--Congestive heart failures--Follow up--Follow-up period--Heart failure--Hyper-parameter optimizations--Machine learning algorithms--Model explainability--Survival event--Synthetic minority over-sampling techniques--Up period--Heart;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85190651000

The input layer, hidden layers, and output layer of the network are thus manifested. The network attempts to learn from the data that is fed to it and then makes predictions accordingly. ANN is one of the most basic types of neural network. The Artificial Neural Network does not have any specific structure--it comprises multiple neural layers for prediction. The effective application of deep learning happens in the fields like finances, marketing, and retail which has inspired the other sectors. It can be effectively applied to healthcare and medical science, such as cardiology. Doctors have a considerable amount of data in hospitals and clinics--unfortunately, there is insufficient knowledge to use the data to make a persuasive heart disease prediction decision. This paper aims to bring an effective study of machine learning in Heart Disease Prediction for scalable datasets. The study also concludes that the significant factors affecting heart disease are classified into four factors: socio-demographic characteristics, family history, medical history, environmental risk factors, and dietary/lifestyle factors. It also sub-classifies them as adjustable and non-adjustable with a detailed list. © 2024, CRC Press/Balkema.

It is a major public health problem and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Care workers intentionally mine and save patient medical information to generate potential for enhanced treatment planning as healthcare and creative diagnostics become much more collaborative. To predict strokes, this paper does a comprehensive evaluation of the many variables in electronic heart data. The most crucial variables for stroke prediction are identified using a principal component analysis. We have considered a set of 12 different attribute which are a common symptom of various heart conditions. The features are employed to predict cardiovascular disease, each attributes contains 918 data set which are taken from Kaggle. The data set are trained on 70% and tested on 30% of Kaggle heart dataset. We apply the test and training data on different machine learning algorithm, i.e., K Neighbors Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and on deep neural network and achieve the results. On comparing the accuracy result of all three methods, i.e., K Neighbors Classifier accuracy result 0.877, Random Forest Classifier accuracy result 0.8590, and deep neural network accuracy result 0.89.

The correct treatment for COVID-19 has not yet been identified because vaccine receivers have also contracted the illness. People's lives can be saved, and patients can be shielded from laborious treatments with the quick and accurate diagnosis of coronavirus. Investigators have utilized various clinical imaging modalities i.e., CT-Scan and X-ray for the identification of coronavirus, while, less emphasis is spent on the utilization of ECG images in recognizing the COVID-19-affected patients. In contrast to CT-Scan and X-ray images, ECG samples are readily accessible, hence we utilize them to diagnose coronavirus. Since scientists generally transform the ECG data into integer representation before using any approach, which indicates higher computing overhead. Accurate and quick coronavirus identification from the ECG modality is a difficult and cumbersome operation. In this study, we attempted to address these issues by leveraging the ECG files directly in an improved deep learning (DL) methodology called the COVID-ECG-RSNet. Descriptively, a novel DL model is presented by altering the ResNet-50 model by introducing an optimized activation approach called the Swish method during the feature engineering process. Moreover, we introduced multiple dense layers at the end of the proposed CNN structure to ensure more robust sample features for classification purposes. The introduced COVID-ECG-RSNet model is proficient in categorizing the ECG samples as being normal, coronavirus, myocardial infarction (MI), abnormal heartbeats (AHB), and victims with Previous history of Myocardial Infarction (PMI) groups. A vast evaluation with the help of a complicated and publically accessible data sample of ECG images is accomplished to show the effectiveness of our approach in recognizing the coronavirus images in contrast to other categories of heart diseases and healthy samples via using the ECG modality. We have attained an accuracy score of 98.8%, along with precision, and recall scores of 98.9%, and 98.7% respectively indicating the efficacy of suggested approach. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd;Classification--COVID--ECG--ResNet50;Cardiology--Computerized tomography--Coronavirus--Deep learning--Diseases--Image classification--Image enhancement--Coronaviruses--COVID--CT-scan--ECG data--Imaging modality--Integer representation--Learning models--Myocardial Infarction--Resnet50--X-ray image--adult--Article--convolutional neural network--coronavirus disease 2019--cost effectiveness analysis--deep learning--ECG abnormality--electrocardiogram--electrocardiography--female--heart infarction--human--machine learning--major clinical study--male--performance indicator--residual neural network--scientist--X ray--x-ray computed tomography--Electrocardiograms;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85179003496

However, integrating these measurements into complex disease recognition and therapeutic interventions remains challenging. While the tools have been developed, there is a lack of evidence regarding implementing heterogeneous systems for guiding clinical decision-making and therapeutic action. Recent findings: Newer AI modalities have shown concrete positive data in terms of user-guided image acquisition and processing, precise determination of both basic and advanced quantitative echocardiographic features, and the potential to construct predictive models, all with the possibility of seamless integration into clinical decision support systems. Summary: AI in echocardiography is a powerful and ever-growing tool with the potential for revolutionary effects on the practice of cardiology.

Initially seen only as a disease of the respiratory system, COVID-19 is actually a blood disease with effects on the respiratory tract. Considering its influence on hematological parameters, how does COVID-19 affect cardiac function? Is it possible to support the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 from the automatic analysis of electrocardiography? In this work, we sought to investigate how COVID-19 affects cardiac function using a machine learning approach to analyze electrocardiography (ECG) signals. We used a public database of ECG signals expressed as photographs of printed signals, obtained in the context of emergency care. This database has signals associated with abnormal heartbeat, myocardial infarction, history of myocardial infarction, COVID-19, and healthy heartbeat. We propose a system to support the diagnosis of COVID-19 based on hybrid deep architectures composed of pre-trained convolutional neural networks for feature extraction and Random Forests for classification. We investigated the LeNet, ResNet, and VGG16 networks. The best results were obtained with the VGG16 and Random Forest network with 100 trees, with attribute selection using particle swarm optimization. The instance size has been reduced from 4096 to 773 attributes. In the validation step, we obtained an accuracy of 94%, kappa index of 0.91, and sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve of 100%. This work showed that the influence of COVID-19 on cardiac function is quite considerable: COVID-19 did not present confusion with any heart disease, nor with signs of healthy individuals.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, especially machine and deep learning techniques are more impactful and powerful tools for upgrading the capabilities of an application, and they have been applied to medical data for analysis and disease detection purposes. This paper, represents a comprehensive view of AI-based computational modeling with the abilities of powerful AI techniques that can play a crucial role in developing smart and enhanced systems in a real-world application. The paper outlines the broad overview of AI-based modeling that can be utilized in various application domains. An electrocardiogram (ECG) plays a major role in biomedical applications to record the heartbeat activity. Regular monitoring of ECG through wearable devices like the band, watches, etc. can be done for early detection of cardiovascular diseases. The competency of each method discussed is related to ECG classification approaches that have been compared in terms of some parameters like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictivity, and F-score. The noise affects the ECG signal which may deteriorate the features of the respective signal that leading to improper treatment. De-noising has been done by pre-processing of the signal, which enables the prediction of the heart condition. After detecting the positions of the P wave, QRS wave, and T wave, feature extraction has been done. The efficiency of ECG classification with different computational methods was evaluated with proposed algorithms by using different databases like MIT-BIH, PTB, and MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation test. It has been observed from the literature that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are best suited for the classification and detection of arrhythmia. The challenges of existing techniques to analyze the ECG signal for the classification and detection of arrhythmia are summarized. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Center for Numerical Methods in Engineering (CIMNE).;;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Cardiovascular system--Classification (of information)--Computational efficiency--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Diseases--Feature extraction--Learning systems--Medical applications--Seismic waves--Analysis detection--Artificial intelligence techniques--Cardiovascular disease--Computational modelling--Disease detection--Electrocardiogram signal--Health-related problems--Learning techniques--Medical data--Systematic Review--Electrocardiograms;Springer Science and Business Media B.V.;;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85139174215

While machine-learning algorithms have been presented to classify different heart conditions via auscultation, these models typically output a single-label decision and offer little insight into the magnitude or severity of the classified condition. The inner workings of these networks are a ‘black box’, offering a diagnosis prediction without a metric for explaining how the conclusion was drawn. Here, we present a novel approach, combining deep convolutional neural networks and explainable AI algorithms, to extract key temporal signatures in recordings of multiple heart conditions to enable multi-label classification and severity determination. Signatures found are supported by previous research and offer more information than a simple single-label classification algorithm. The neural networks are able to reach a multi-label classification accuracy of up to 78% (alongside 98% single-label accuracy) after being trained solely on single-label data. This approach may assist physicians in making quick, accurate, and comprehensive diagnoses and provide new insights for the progress of multi-label machine learning for medical diagnosis. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd;Auscultation--Convolutional neural network--Explainable-AI--Machine learning--Phonocardiogram--Regurgitation--Spectrogram--Stenosis;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Computer aided diagnosis--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep neural networks--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Phonocardiography--Spectrographs--Auscultation--Condition--Convolutional neural network--Explainable-AI--Machine-learning--Multi-label classifications--Phonocardiograms--Regurgitation--Spectrograms--Stenoses--adolescent--adult--algorithm--aortic stenosis--area under the curve--Article--artificial intelligence--artificial neural network--auscultation--cardiovascular system examination--child--classification algorithm--clinical article--cohort analysis--convolutional neural network--deep neural network--discrete wavelet transform--disease severity--explainable artificial intelligence--female--heart disease--human--k nearest neighbor--male--mitral valve prolapse--mitral valve regurgitation--mitral valve stenosis--multilabel classification--phonocardiography--prediction error--qualitative analysis--quantitative analysis--receiver operating characteristic--residual neural network--support vector machine--temporal analysis--Heart;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85159193897

Identifying the abnormalities in heart sound needs excellent auscultation skills and experience. Thus an electronic stethoscope is designed and developed using different microphonic heads. In this research work, hardware development of an electronic stethoscope interfaced with raspberry pi 4B and software development of the proposed CNN-based deep learning model is carried out. The Bluetooth-enabled electronic stethoscope is used to auscultate the heart sound analyzed with a developed deep learning Convolutional Neural Network-based Efficient Network model. The developed CNN model is designed with classifiers to predict valvular diseases accurately. The analysis result is almost in real-time processed and stored in the Cloud. The design provides a better way of studying PCG signal analysis, which eventually reduces the cost and makes the system compact. The proposed model has been trained through a standard and validated heart sound bank of normal and abnormal diseases and predicts the abnormality with accuracy. The proposed modified Efficient Net - B3 model scored an accuracy of 99.35 ± 0.34% on the test dataset with a sensitivity of 98.84 ± 0.07% and specificity of 98.23 ± 0.52%. The Selenium Web Driver tool with Google Drive API is used to automate the web application PCG signal analysis. Finally, the SQLite database has been used as a back-end server to store the patient record. The system is low-cost and portable, with data remotely accessible and tested with volunteers. The developed system can be used in rural areas where there is a lack of medical facilities exists and can be used to initiate primary screening of valvular diseases. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd;Classification--Cloud storage--Convolutional neural network--Electronic stethoscope--Feature extraction--Graphical user interface--Machine learning--PCG signal--Python programming--Real-time data acquisition--Remote telemedicine--Residual network--Selenium web driver--SQLite--Valvular heart disease prediction;Cardiology--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Cost benefit analysis--Data acquisition--Data handling--Deep learning--Digital storage--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Graphical user interfaces--Heart--Learning systems--Selenium--Signal analysis--Software design--Statistical tests--Cloud storages--Convolutional neural network--Electronic stethoscope--Features extraction--Heart disease--Machine-learning--PCG signal--Python programming--Real time data acquisition--Remote telemedicine--Residual network--Selenia web driver--Sqlite--Valvular heart disease prediction--adult--aged--aortic stenosis--Article--clinical assessment--clinical evaluation--cloud computing--comparative study--controlled study--convolutional neural network--deep learning--early diagnosis--equipment design--feature extraction--female--heart cycle--heart sound--human--human experiment--information processing--intrinsic mode function--machine learning--male--medical record--mitral valve prolapse--mitral valve regurgitation--mitral valve stenosis--noise reduction--phonocardiography--prediction--signal noise ratio--telemedicine--transfer of learning--valvular heart disease--Forecasting;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85161507114

However, given the vast amount of publicly available information and recent advances in machine and deep learning techniques, acquiring multifaceted data for accurate diagnosis and medical decision making via artificial intelligence has become more attainable. In this work we illustrate a literature embedding model, which identifies various risk factors, symptoms, mechanisms, and genes associated with CVD using a query word (i.e., “stroke”), and then based on the collected information the model predicts whether or not a person will be susceptible to CVD. For this purpose, we collected published literature from PubMed using search keywords consisting of a word such as “heart” and 19,264 human gene names, then trained our literature embedding model using the collected abstracts. For the intrinsic evaluation, we analyzed whether or not the captured words and genes were correctly identified as risk factors and associated symptoms for the input query words. For the extrinsic evaluation, we used our embedding model as feature selection and dimensionality reduction tasks on cohort data for CVD prediction. Our model accurately (average accuracy of >96 %) captured associated risk factors, symptoms, and genes for a given input query word (intrinsic evaluation). Using the selected features and reduced dimensions, our method provided better performance for CVD prediction with less computational time when compared with other popular methods (extrinsic evaluation). Our model provided outstanding results for both evaluation tasks, which enables accurate risk factor identification for CVD prediction. Our model has the potential to facilitate easier collation of multifaceted information for better data mining of vast publicly available data so that efficient and accurate risk factors and symptoms can be identified, which enables better-informed decisions for CVD prediction and treatment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd;Cardiovascular disease prediction--Information retrieval--Knowledge extraction--Machine learning--Natural language processing--Risk factor identification;Cardiology--Data mining--Decision making--Diagnosis--Diseases--Embeddings--Genes--Machine learning--Natural language processing systems--Cardiovascular disease--Cardiovascular disease prediction--Embeddings--Knowledge extraction--Language processing--Machine-learning--Natural language processing--Natural languages--Risk factor identification--Risk factors--Forecasting;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85139876164

In the medical field, the phonocardiogram (PCG) signal is widely used due to its cost-effectiveness and simplicity. We propose a hybrid classification approach for automatically classifying different cardiac auscultation classes using a PCG signal using handcrafted and deep learned features. Firstly, the PCG signal is split into equal segments using the windowing procedure. The power spectrum of a signal is constructed using l-spectrograms and then the novel modified dilated ResNet structure generates the deep features from the spectrogram images. Simultaneously, handcrafted frequency domain features are extracted from correspond windowed signals. After features are extracted, radial basis function (RBF) kernel in support vector machines (SVM) is used to classify various patterns. Moreover, the optimized SVM is performed using a modified drone squadron optimization (mDSO) algorithm to prevent overfitting. The proposed approach is 94.16% accurate for Michigan Heart Sound and Murmur Database (MHSDB) and 99.38% accurate for PhysioNet/CinC 2016 Challenge. The introduced hybrid model is more computationally efficient and accurate than earlier state-of-the-art strategies, based on the evaluation measures. Using the designed model, underserved and diverse communities can implement automated cardiac screening systems. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.;Cardiovascular diseases--Drone squadron optimization--Feature fusion--Modified ResNet architecture--Optimized learning--Phonocardiogram signals;Cardiology--Cost effectiveness--Decision support systems--Diagnosis--Diseases--Drones--Frequency domain analysis--Heart--Radial basis function networks--Spectrographs--Cardiovascular disease--Drone squadron optimization--Features fusions--Modified resnet architecture--Optimisations--Optimized learning--Phonocardiogram signal--Phonocardiograms--Spectrograms--Support vectors machine--Support vector machines;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85146758857

In addition, there are shortcomings of specialists in developing countries to handle these diseases. Internet of things (IoT) and significant advances in machine learning techniques offers more efficient healthcare services. The research work proposed a IoT enabled, cloud-centric solution for remote monitoring of ECG, which could save lives of rural area people particularly in Golden hour. Firstly, pre-processing of ECG signal is performed using Savitzky-Golay (SG filter) for removal of the baseline wanders and maximum overlap discrete wavelet packet transform (MOWPT) is applied for the removal of high noise followed by delineation process of ECG characteristic points. Then deep learned convolution neural network (CNN) is trained and classification is done. For encryption and authentication, Triple data encryption standard is used for security whereas, water cycle optimization technique is used for authentication. IoT is implemented using the ThingSpeak platform, which enables the visualization and analysed the ECG data over the cloud server. Using ThingSpeak, encrypted and authenticated ECG data is shared with cardiologist for examination. To validate the proposed classification method, the standard annotated dataset of the MIT-BIH database is tested and various performance metrics were calculated. The proposed deep learned CNN classifier classifies the heartbeats into five types of arrhythmias with an average accuracy of 99.12%, whereas the sensitivity and specificity of this proposed model are 100% and 99.9% respectively. The achieved results demonstrated better performance as compared to methods reported in the literature. © 2022;Arrhythmias--Classification--Deep learned convolutional neural network--ECG--IoT--Triple data encryption standard (3-DES)--Water cycle optimization (WCO);Authentication--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Convolution--Cryptography--Data visualization--Deep neural networks--Developing countries--Diseases--Health care--Internet of things--Learning systems--rain--Arrhythmia--Convolution neural network--Convolutional neural network--Data encryption standard--Deep learned convolutional neural network--ECG data--Optimisations--Triple data encryption standard (3-DES)--Water cycle--Water cycle optimization--accuracy--algorithm--Article--artifact--back propagation neural network--cardiovascular disease--controlled study--convolutional neural network--data base--diagnosis--discrete wavelet transform--electrocardiogram--encryption--extrasystole--feature extraction--filtration--genetic algorithm--health care--health service--heart disease--heart rhythm--heart ventricle extrasystole--human--internet of things--knowledge base--machine learning--metaheuristics--morphological trait--multiclass classification--performance indicator--precipitation--processing--remote sensing--RR interval--rural area--sensitivity and specificity--ST segment--support vector machine--time series analysis--training--water cycle--Electrocardiograms;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85141467130

A series of popular deep learning methods have recently been introduced to learn nuance features from RS for binary classifications and achieved outstanding performance than conventional machine learning methods. However, these existing deep learning methods still confront some challenges in classifying subtypes of CVD. For example, the nuance between subtypes is quite hard to capture and represent by intelligent models due to the chillingly similar shape of RS sequences. Moreover, medical history information is an essential resource for distinguishing subtypes, but they are underutilized. In light of this, we propose a multi-modality multi-scale model called M3S, which is a novel deep learning method with two core modules to address these issues. First, we convert RS data to various resolution images by the Gramian angular field (GAF) to enlarge nuance, and a two-branch structure is leveraged to get embeddings for distinction in the multi-scale feature extraction module. Second, a probability matrix and a weight matrix are used to enhance the classification capacity by combining the RS and medical history data in the multi-modality data fusion module. We perform extensive evaluations of M3S and found its outstanding performance on our in-house dataset, with accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score of 0.9330, 0.9379, 0.9291, 0.9752, and 0.9334, respectively. These results demonstrate that the M3S has high performance and robustness compared with popular methods in diagnosing CVD subtypes. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd;Cardiovascular disease--Medical history--Multi-modality--Multi-scale--Raman spectroscopy;Cardiology--Data fusion--Data handling--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Image classification--Learning systems--Matrix algebra--Medical imaging--Cardiovascular disease--Disease diagnosis--Image history--Its efficiencies--Learning methods--Medical history--Multi-modality--Multi-scales--Performance--Raman images--Raman spectroscopy;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85151338882

This study aims at modeling predictive models for medical data. Two datasets of medical data are applied in the study — one online available dataset (Heart Disease data) and another real clinical dataset (Eye Infection Data). A wide range of machine learning algorithms are applied in the modeling stage: Decision Tree, Multilayer Perceptron, Naive Bayesian, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. Furthermore, bagging and voting ensemble methods have also been applied with base learners. Both split and cross-validation methods are adopted for the model validation, and well-established evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure have been considered as evaluation metrics for the predictive models. The method applied for the modeling is comprised of two stages. The first stage uses available features for the predictions. In the second stage, selected features based on positive correlation are used. The adopted method is also for deep learning, especially Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied to analyze the outcomes compared to conventional machine learning algorithms. The experimental results reveal that better predictions are achieved in the second stage. Besides, experiments also indicate split percentage produces better predictive models, and marginally better outcomes are observed in the presence of ensemble methods in comparison with base models.

It is quite challenging to identify heart diseases when the symptoms or characteristics vary. In the contemporary digital environment, the healthcare sector produces a considerable volume of patient data. For doctors, manually processing these created data becomes exceedingly challenging. The Internet of Things is handling the generated data quite well. It provides continuous communication between individuals and devices, and its fusion with the Cloud enhances the quality of life. Materials and Methods: Deep learning, a branch of machine learning, has the transformational ability to rapidly and reliably analyse massive amounts of data, produce insightful conclusions, and effectively resolve complex problems. Massive volumes of data were collected by the IoT, and because of deep-learning algorithms, it is now possible to identify and diagnose diseases. The suggested approach collects information from IoT devices, and electronic medical evidence connected to patient histories that are stored in the cloud are sent to predictive analytics.

An important physiological signal of human body is heart sound and it arises due to the blood turbulence and pulsing of cardiac structures. For the early diagnosis of heart diseases, the analysis of heart sounds play an important role as they contain a huge quantity of pathological information associated with heart. To detect heart sounds, Phonocardiogram (PCG) is used as it is a highly useful and non-invasive technique and can be easily analyzed well. In this paper, some efficient models are proposed for the classification of PCG signals. Two important and robust conglomerated models are proposed initially, wherein the first strategy utilizes the concept of semi-supervised Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) along with Brain Storming (BS) optimization algorithm and an advanced version of BS termed as Advanced BS (ABS) is proposed and then it is merged with Genetic Programming (GP) so that new algorithms such as BS-GP and ABS-GP are formed and finally the features selected through it are fed to classification through machine learning. The second strategy utilizes the concept of using three dimensionality reduction techniques along with Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering and then an Advanced Sine-Cosine (ASC) optimization algorithm with three different modifications is proposed for the purpose of feature selection and finally it is classified. Deep learning techniques were also employed in the study such as the usage of an Attention based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (A-BLSTM), Ordinal Variational Autoencoder (O-VAE), Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE), Hyperspherical CVAE (H-CVAE) and the Restricted Boltzmann Machine based Deep Belief Network (RBM-DBN) for the classification of PCG signals. The experiment is conducted on a publicly available dataset and results show that a high classification accuracy of 95.39% is obtained for the semi-supervised NMF concept with ABS-GP technique and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd;Deep learning--Feature selection--Machine learning--NMF--PCG;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Clustering algorithms--Computer aided diagnosis--Deep learning--Diseases--Feature Selection--Genetic algorithms--Genetic programming--Heart--Learning systems--Matrix algebra--Non-negative matrix factorization--Support vector machines--Auto encoders--Deep learning--Features selection--Heart sounds--Machine-learning--Matrix factorizations--Negative matrix factorization--Optimization algorithms--Phonocardiograms--Semi-supervised--Classification (of information);Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85149186171

The current study used the ECG to classify cardiac signals into normal heartbeats, congestive heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation arrhythmias, atrial flutter, malignant ventricular arrhythmias, and premature atrial fibrillation. A deep learning algorithm was used to identify and diagnose cardiac arrhythmias. We proposed a new ECG signal classification method to increase signal classification sensitivity. We smoothed the ECG signal with noise removal filters. A discrete wavelet transform based on an arrhythmic database was applied to extract ECG features. Feature vectors were obtained based on wavelet decomposition energy properties and calculated values of PQRS morphological features. We used the genetic algorithm to reduce the feature vector and determine the input layer weights of the artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Proposed methods for classifying ECG signals were in different classes of rhythm to diagnose heart rhythm diseases. Training data was with 80% of the data set and test data was with 20% for the whole data set. The learning accuracy for the results of training and test data in the ANN classifier was calculated as 99.9% and 88.92% and in ANFIS as 99.8% and 88.83% respectively.

Recently, to facilitate early identification and diagnosis, efforts have been made in the research and development of new wearable devices to make them smaller, more comfortable, more accurate, and increasingly compatible with artificial intelligence technologies. These efforts can pave the way to the longer and continuous health monitoring of different biosignals, including the real-time detection of diseases, thus providing more timely and accurate predictions of health events that can drastically improve the healthcare management of patients. Most recent reviews focus on a specific category of disease, the use of artificial intelligence in 12-lead electrocardiograms, or on wearable technology. However, we present recent advances in the use of electrocardiogram signals acquired with wearable devices or from publicly available databases and the analysis of such signals with artificial intelligence methods to detect and predict diseases. As expected, most of the available research focuses on heart diseases, sleep apnea, and other emerging areas, such as mental stress. From a methodological point of view, although traditional statistical methods and machine learning are still widely used, we observe an increasing use of more advanced deep learning methods, specifically architectures that can handle the complexity of biosignal data. These deep learning methods typically include convolutional and recurrent neural networks. Moreover, when proposing new artificial intelligence methods, we observe that the prevalent choice is to use publicly available databases rather than collecting new data. © 2023 by the authors.;deep learning--ECG--m-health--machine learning--wearable technology;Artificial Intelligence--Electrocardiography--Humans--Intelligence--Sleep Apnea Syndromes--Wearable Electronic Devices--Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Diseases--E-learning--Health risks--Learning systems--Recurrent neural networks--Signal analysis--Wearable technology--Artificial intelligence methods--Cardiovascular disease--Deep learning--Diagnostic capabilities--Health condition--Learning methods--Machine-learning--Population aging--Sleep apnea--Wearable devices--artificial intelligence--electrocardiography--human--intelligence--sleep apnea syndromes--Electrocardiograms;MDPI;37430719;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85160407540

Detection of HVD is critical as untreated heart valve disease often develops life-threatening cardiac diseases. Typical HVD detection methods, like echocardiography, MRI, and cardiac CT, are costly, complex, and require robust healthcare infrastructure. Although, by simple non-invasive listening to heart sound irregularities, an expert physician can anticipate the signs of HVD from ancient times. Contemporary development suggests that with machine learning-based algorithms, a graphical representation of heart sound, known as the phonocardiogram (PCG), can effectively predict the anomaly in the valvular activity. In recent studies, deep learning-based strategies showed promising results in the PCG classification task but demand extensive resources and training data. This work investigates the merits of transfer learning (TL) using pre-trained convolution neural networks for the automatic PCG classification when data is scarce. With standard time–frequency representations (i.e., spectrogram, log-Mel spectrogram, and scalogram) as input features, audio and image-based pre-trained lightweight models are fine-tuned to categorize the PCG. The proposed YAMNet-based TL method classifies four types of HVD data collected from public heart sound databases and achieves overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 99.83%, 99.59%, and 99.90%, respectively. Alongside, it classifies the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2016 dataset into binary classes with 92.23% accuracy. The study achieves high classification metrics despite data scarcity. It also investigates the proposed method's computational efficiency and robustness against practical noise contamination for performance evaluation in a possible real-life scenario. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd;Heart valve disease--PCG--Spectrogram--Time–frequency representation--Transfer learning--YAMNet;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Computational efficiency--Computerized tomography--Deep learning--Echocardiography--Heart--Phonocardiography--Disease classification--Heart sounds--Heart valve disease--Heart valves--Phonocardiograms--Physiological condition--Spectrograms--Time-frequency representations--Transfer learning--YAMNet--aortic valve stenosis--Article--artifact--continuous wavelet transform--convolutional neural network--diagnostic accuracy--diagnostic test accuracy study--disease classification--feature extraction--heart cycle--heart sound--human--major clinical study--mitral valve prolapse--mitral valve regurgitation--mitral valve stenosis--phonocardiography--sensitivity and specificity--short time Fourier transform--transfer of learning--valvular heart disease--Classification (of information);Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85150352863

However, previous studies on cardiovascular disease detection are mainly based on single-modal data, i.e. ECG or PCG alone. With the fast development of deep learning, researchers begin to pay attention to the detection of cardiovascular diseases using multi-modal data. In this study, we propose a multi-branch residual network that can automatically extract deep features from ECG and PCG signals. Different residual branches (SE-ResNet) can extract features at different scales. We use PCA to select the fused features and apply SVM classifier for classification. The experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy of our proposed method is 93.1% with an AUC value of 0.967, which outperforms methods using single-modal data as well as existing studies using multi-modal data.

Rather than utilizing the spatial information of the original delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance (DE-MRI) images, Auto-MyIn uses the textural information obtained by applying grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) of four different grey levels to train the three CNNs (ResNet-18, DarkNet-19, and SqueezeNet). First, the images generated from each GLCM grey level are used to train each CNN individually. Next, for each GLCM grey level, the textural-based deep features extracted from the three CNNs are concatenated and used to train several support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Finally, Auto-MyIn fuses textural-based deep features of the four GLCM grey levels using principal component analysis (PCA). The results of Auto-MyIn indicated that fusing the textural-based deep features of each level of GLCM is better than the end-to-end deep learning classification of the three CNNs trained with each grey level of GLCM images. Furthermore, it showed that fusing textural-based deep features of the four grey levels of the GLCM using PCA has further improvement on diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, the results prove that using textural information is superior to using spatial information of the original DE-MRI images. In addition, the results of Auto-MyIn when compared with other related studies demonstrated its competitive ability. Moreover, the performance of Auto-MyIn shows an accuracy of 0.984, a sensitivity of 0.992, specificity of 0.968, and precision of 0.967, which indicate that it is a reliable tool, therefore it could be employed to help in the clinical decision making and facilitate the diagnostic process of MI thus avoiding the limitations of manual diagnosis. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd;Artificial Intelligence (AI)--Cardiovascular (CV) Diseases--Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)--Deep Learning--Grey level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)--Myocardial Infarction (MI) Diagnosis--Support Vector Machine (SVM);Cardiology--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Decision making--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Image enhancement--Information use--Magnetic resonance--Magnetic resonance imaging--Principal component analysis--Artificial intelligence--Cardiovascular disease--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Gray level co-occurrence matrix--Gray-level co-occurrence matrix--Grey-level co-occurrence matrixes--Myocardial Infarction--Myocardial infarction  diagnose--Support vector machine--Support vectors machine--Article--cardiovascular magnetic resonance--clinical decision making--computer assisted diagnosis--controlled study--convolutional neural network--deep learning--diagnostic accuracy--diagnostic test accuracy study--feature extraction--grey level co occurrence matrix--heart infarction--human--image analysis--machine learning--major clinical study--principal component analysis--residual neural network--sensitivity and specificity--support vector machine--Support vector machines;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85140139580

In the field of medical research, medical knowledge discovery from electronic medical records is a common medical data mining method, but it is difficult to validate the discovered medical knowledge without the participation of medical experts. In this article, we propose a data-driven medical knowledge discovery closed-loop pipeline based on interpretable machine learning and deep learning--the components of the pipeline include Data Generator, Medical Knowledge Mining, Medical Knowledge Evaluation, and Medical Knowledge Application. In addition to completing the discovery of medical knowledge, the pipeline can also automatically validate the knowledge. We apply our pipeline's discovered medical knowledge to a traditional prognostic predictive model of heart failure in a real-world study, demonstrating that the incorporation of medical knowledge can effectively improve the performance of the traditional model. We also construct a scale model based on the discovered medical knowledge and demonstrate that it achieves good performance. To guarantee its medical effectiveness, every process of our pipeline involves the participation of medical experts. © 2013 IEEE.;Electronic Medical Records--Heart Failure--Machine Learning--Medical Knowledge Discovery;Artificial Intelligence--Data Mining--Humans--Knowledge Discovery--Machine Learning--Prognosis--Cardiology--Deep learning--E-learning--Learning systems--Machine components--Medical computing--Pipelines--Biomedical imaging--Data driven--Electronic medical record--Generator--Heart failure--Machine-learning--Medical knowledge--Medical knowledge discovery--Medical record--Predictive models--aged--Article--artificial intelligence--case control study--controlled study--data mining--deep learning--diagnostic test accuracy study--female--heart failure--human--hypertension--in-hospital mortality--interpretable data driven medical knowledge discovery--knowledge discovery--machine learning--major clinical study--male--mortality risk--New York--pipeline--predictive model--prognosis--propensity score--receiver operating characteristic--risk assessment--procedures--Data mining;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;37498763;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85166337554

These opportunities include applications in converting nuclear cardiology imaging reports to digital searchable information that may be used as Big Data for machine learning and registries. Another major NLP application is, with the support of AI, in automatically translating MPI image features directly into nuclear cardiology reports. This review describes the symbiotic relationship between AI and NLP in that NLP is being used to facilitate AI applications and, AI techniques are being used to facilitate NLP. This article reviews the fundamentals of NLP and describes various conventional and AI techniques that have been applied in imaging.

Artificial intelligence shows strength in assisting researchers and clinicians in CT scan information reading. CTA data provides a series of scans of images from patients and thus could be reconstructed as three dimensions (3-D) images, also known as volume rendering images. We use the projection of those 3-D images as a dataset and developed a deep neural network with Transformer to diagnose coronary heart diseases automatically. Compared with several traditional and classic deep learning methods, i.e. simple CNN, VGGNet, and ResNet which show accuracy of 52.5%, 57.82%, and 76.3%, respectively, vision transformer(ViT) improves it to 81.5%. Besides, we take great advantage of the vision transformer and series of CTA. Based on that, we developed a new deep learning model Vision-Series Transformer(ViST). It has better performance in accuracy(83.78%). 5-fold cross-validation was used to determine whether it performs better in other statistical indicators. It shows the same high sensitivity and specificity as ViT, better than that of other models. The results show that both ViT and ViST could be used in screening for CHD, while ViST has better statistical indicators. © 2023 Owner/Author.;;Angiography--Cardiology--Computerized tomography--Deep neural networks--Heart--Learning systems--Volume rendering--3-D image--Coronary heart disease--CT angiography--CT-scan--Learning methods--Machine-learning--Research support--Series transformer--Statistical indicators--Three dimensions--Diseases;Association for Computing Machinery;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85168116345

The increasing availability of electrophysiological signals collected through conventional methods (e.g. electrocardiography (ECG)) and digital health technologies (e.g. wearable devices) in combination with novel predictive analytics using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) hold potential for personalised predictions of arrhythmic events. Methods: This systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis assesses the state-of-the-art of ML/DL models of electrophysiological signals for personalised prediction of malignant VA or SCD, and studies potential causes of bias (PROSPERO, reference: CRD42021283464). Five electronic databases were searched to identify eligible studies. Pooled estimates of the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and summary area under the curve (AUROC) were calculated. Meta-analyses were performed separately for studies using publicly available, ad-hoc datasets, versus targeted clinical data acquisition. Studies were scored on risk of bias by the PROBAST tool. Findings: 2194 studies were identified of which 46 were included in the systematic review and 32 in the meta-analysis. Pooling of individual models demonstrated a summary AUROC of 0.856 (95% CI 0.755–0.909) for short-term (time-to-event up to 72 h) prediction and AUROC of 0.876 (95% CI 0.642–0.980) for long-term prediction (time-to-event up to years). While models developed on ad-hoc sets had higher pooled performance (AUROC 0.919, 95% CI 0.867–0.952), they had a high risk of bias related to the re-use and overlap of small ad-hoc datasets, choices of ML tool and a lack of external model validation. Interpretation: ML and DL models appear to accurately predict malignant VA and SCD. However, wide heterogeneity between studies, in part due to small ad-hoc datasets and choice of ML model, may reduce the ability to generalise and should be addressed in future studies.

In medicine, DL methods have been also used to improve the efficiency of disease diagnosis. In this review, we first summarize the history of the development of artificial intelligence models, demonstrate the features of the subtypes of machine learning and different DL networks, and then explore their application in the different fields of precision medicine, such as cardiology, gastroenterology, ophthalmology, dermatology, and oncology. By digging more information and extracting multilevel features from medical data, we found that DL helps doctors assess diseases automatically and monitor patients' physical health. In gliomas, research regarding application prospect of DL was mainly shown through magnetic resonance imaging and then by pathological slides. However, multi-omics data, such as whole exome sequence, RNA sequence, proteomics, and epigenomics, have not been covered thus far. In general, the quality and quantity of DL datasets still need further improvements, and more fruitful multi-omics characteristics will bring more comprehensive and accurate diagnosis in precision medicine and glioma. © 2023 The Authors.

Cardiovascular disease is responsible for around 31% of global deaths, resulting in over 17.9 million deaths, making it a global health issue. Classifiers and common methods for encoding categorical data using machine learning have revealed a broad variety of surprising findings when used to identify cardiac disease based on small datasets from testing. To extract features without developing a comprehension of sequence information, the early research used convolutional neural networks (CNN)—a type of deep learning model. A deep learning-based system, particularly a CNN with bidirectional long/short-term memory, is proposed in this study in order to efficiently predict cardiovascular disease from patient data. Only the most applicable features were selected via feature selection, which was accomplished by prioritizing and picking features that were highly rated in the supplied disease dataset. After that, the CNN + BiLSTM-based hybrid deep learning technique was employed to predict cardiovascular illness. In contrast to past studies of a similar kind, the experimental outcomes of this hybrid deep learning technique were encouraging: 94.507% accuracy, % precision, % recall, and an F1-score of 94%. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.;Cardiovascular disease prediction--Deep learning--Disease diagnoses--Supervised learning;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Hospital data processing--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Cardiovascular disease--Cardiovascular disease prediction--Causes of death--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Disease diagnosis--Global health--Health issues--Learning techniques--World Health Organization--Forecasting;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85145162002

As such, advances in machine- and deep-learning technologies pave the way to high throughput approaches to automated classification of cardiac abnormalities. While there is rich literature on ECG-based classification of cardiac conditions, particularly on diagnosing Atrial Fibrillation, there is a dearth on algorithms that can effectively measure the onset and offset of atrial fibrillation events within an ECG. In this work, we show that an off-the-shelf machine learning algorithm can be trained on mathematically-computable shape signatures embedded within the local topology of ECGs to identify fibrillatory episodes in ECGs of AF patients. More precisely, we show that a topology-informed machine learning algorithm can accurately classify segments within an ECG as either resembling an atrial fibrillation event or not. Furthermore, we show that based on the model-provided classification of segments, a simple criterion may be used to determine whether the AF rhythm is paroxysmal or persistent.  © 2023 ACM.;machine learning--paroxysmal atrial fibrillation--persistent homology--topological data analysis;Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Topology--Atrial fibrillation--Automated classification--Condition--High-throughput approaches--Learning technology--Machine learning algorithms--Machine-learning--Paroxysmal atrial fibrillations--Persistent homology--Topological data analysis--Electrocardiograms;Association for Computing Machinery;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85163310597

The cloud service provider's data centers store vast amounts of data without processing it. This big data need some intelligent technique to analyze and classify heart disease from the considerable volume of data--it is a challenging task. Many deep learning techniques are introduced earlier for heart disease diagnosis in the literature study. Still, all other classification techniques failed to achieve the minimum loss in heart disease classification with the highest accuracy and faster performance. This research introduces a new classification approach to overcome these issues: elephant herding optimizer turned restricted Boltzmann machine EHO-RBM network. The optimizer is used in this network to optimize the number of neuron utilization during the learning process by updating the network weight without compromising the loss. The previous research proves that the optimizer is performed well in reaching global minima efficiently. Therefore, the new classifier incorporates the optimizers instead of the classical stochastic gradient descent optimizer to improve the network performance by minimizing the global minima faster with less loss in predicting heart disease. The simulation result of the new heart disease classification framework shows that the elephant herding optimizer-trained classification model has reduced the loss rate and maximized the accuracy rate up to 0.0027 then the comparison method. As a result, the new classifier has obtained a maximum accuracy of up to 99.96%.  © 2023 - IOS Press.

We sought to compare a 2-zone, anterior-superior thoracic ultrasound protocol for B-line artifact detection with an 8-zone approach in patients with known or suspected heart failure using a deep learning (DL) algorithm. Methods: Adult patients with suspected heart failure and B-lines on initial lung ultrasound were enrolled in a prospective observational study. Subjects received daily ultrasounds with a hand-held ultrasound system using an 8-zone protocol (right and left anterior/lateral and superior/inferior). A previously published deep learning algorithm that rates severity of B-lines on a 0–4 scale was adapted for use on hand-held ultrasound full video loops. Average severities for 8 and 2 zones were calculated utilizing DL ratings. Bland–Altman plot analyses were used to assess agreement and identify bias between 2- and 8-zone scores for both primary (all patients, 5728 videos, 205 subjects) and subgroup (confirmed diagnosis of heart failure or pulmonary edema, 4464 videos, 147 subjects) analyses. Results: Bland–Altman plot analyses revealed excellent agreement for both primary and subgroup analyses.

A high correlation between arterial blood pressure (ABP) and Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal enables using a PPG signal to monitor and classify BP continuously. Control of BP in realtime is the basis for the prevention of hypertension. Proposed approach: This work proposes a CS-NET architecture by unifying CNN and SVM approaches to classify BP using PPG signals. The main objective of the CS-NET method is to establish an accurate and reliable algorithm for the ABP classification. Methodology: ABP signals are labeled normal and abnormal using the hypertension criteria the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) laid down. The proposed CS-NET model incorporates three critical steps in three successive stages. The first stage includes converting a preprocessed PPG signal into a time-frequency (TF) representation called a super-resolution spectrogram by superlet transform. The second stage uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with several hidden layers to extract morphological features from every PPG super-resolution spectrogram. The third stage uses a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to classify the PPG signal. Results: PPG signals are used to train and test the proposed model. The performance of the proposed CS-NET method is tested using MIMIC-II, MIMIC-III, and PPG-BP-figshare database in terms of accuracy and F1 score. Moreover, the CS-NET method achieves better results with high accuracy when compared with other benchmark approaches that require an electrocardiogram signal for reference. Conclusions: The proposed model achieved an aggregate classification accuracy of 98.21% across a five-fold cross-validation technique, making it a reliable approach for BP classification in clinical settings and realtime monitoring. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.;Arterial blood pressure (ABP)--Deep learning--Hypertension--Photoplethysmography (PPG)--Superlet transform, Convolutional neural network (CNN)--Support vector machine (SVM);Blood Pressure--Blood Pressure Determination--Humans--Hypertension--Neural Networks, Computer--Photoplethysmography--Support Vector Machine--Biomedical signal processing--Blood--Blood pressure--Cardiology--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Glucose--Image enhancement--Multilayer neural networks--Network architecture--Optical resolving power--Photoplethysmography--Arterial blood pressure--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Hypertension--Photoplethysmography--Superlet transform, convolutional neural network--Superresolution--Support vector machine--Support vectors machine--Article--blood pressure monitoring--classifier--controlled study--convolutional neural network--diagnostic accuracy--diagnostic test accuracy study--disease classification--feature extraction--human--hypertension--intermethod comparison--k fold cross validation--learning algorithm--major clinical study--model--multilayer perceptron--photoelectric plethysmography--prehypertension--support vector machine--wavelet transform--artificial neural network--blood pressure--blood pressure measurement--hypertension--photoelectric plethysmography--procedures--Support vector machines;Elsevier Ireland Ltd;37542944;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85166740947

Prompt and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective clinical management. Chest X-ray (CXR) and chest computed tomography (CT) are commonly used for confirming the diagnosis, but they can be time-consuming and biased. To address this, we developed a computationally efficient deep feature engineering model called Hybrid-Patch-Alex for automated COVID-19, COPD, and HF diagnosis. We utilized one CXR dataset and two CT image datasets, including a newly collected dataset with four classes: COVID-19, COPD, HF, and normal. Our model employed a hybrid patch division method, transfer learning with pre-trained AlexNet, iterative neighborhood component analysis for feature selection, and three standard classifiers (k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and artificial neural network) for automated classification. The model achieved high accuracy rates of 99.82%, 92.90%, and 97.02% on the respective datasets, using kNN and SVM classifiers. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.;AlexNet--biomedical image classification--CT image classification--Hybrid-Patch-Alex--transfer learning;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Computerized tomography--Deterioration--Diagnosis--Feature extraction--Image classification--Iterative methods--Nearest neighbor search--Neural networks--Pulmonary diseases--Support vector machines--Alexnet--Biomedical image classification--Biomedical images--Computed tomography image classification--Computed tomography images--Heart failure--Hybrid-patch-alex--Images classification--Transfer learning--COVID-19;John Wiley and Sons Inc;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85161089102

Early prognosis of this disorder is the most viable strategy for increasing the prospects of individuals' survival. Numerous methods exploiting machine learning algorithms for heart disease prediction have been reported in the literature, but they all suffer from overfitting problems. Conspicuously, to improve the prediction accuracy, in this research work, an efficient meta-heuristic-based feature selection technique, namely NSGA-II, is employed. The proposed solution aims to reduce the feature set and thus improve the prediction accuracy supported by intelligent machine learning models. The presented classifier is trained and validated using a comprehensive heart disease dataset by utilizing NSGA-II selected features with 10-fold cross-validation. For performance validation, the results of the proposed model are compared with the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, such as a k-nearest neighbour, support vector machine, Bayesian belief networks, random forest, and naive bayes. The simulation results highlight the improved performance of the proposed model with NSGA-II and achieve a high prediction accuracy of 97.32%. Furthermore, results of sensitivity (92.84%), specificity (92.60%), precision (91.25%), and F-measure (92.17%) prove the utility of the proposed approach for heart disease prediction over all other variants. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.;cross-validation--feature selection--heart disease--machine learning--NSGA-II;Bayesian networks--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Feature Selection--Heart--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Nearest neighbor search--Support vector machines--Cross validation--Features selection--Heart disease--Learning frameworks--Machine learning algorithms--Machine-learning--NSGA-II--Over fitting problem--Prediction accuracy--Premature death--Forecasting;John Wiley and Sons Inc;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85148610183

The detection of ECG characteristic waveforms is particularly important in automatic heart disease diagnosis. Although researchers have proposed many detection methods, the detection under the inter-patient pattern is still a challenge. Method: This paper proposed an end-to-end ECG waveform detection method (ECT-net) based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and transformer. We constructed the feature extractor by a group of convolutional layers to extract the local information of ECG signals and generate the input embedding of the transformer encoder. Meanwhile, we adopted the transformer encoder to extract the long-term time-dependent representation between heartbeats, which can make up for the limitation of the CNN in obtaining global information. This structure ensures that both spatial and temporal features from ECG signals are achieved. For precise detection, we employed a corresponding decoder and skip structure to integrate low-level features and high-level features. The model was trained and verified on the China Physiological Signal Challenge 2018 database (CPSC-DB). Result: Our method performed best among comparison methods and achieved F1 scores of 94.27% on the P wave, 97.32% on the QRS wave, and 93.92% on the T wave. The ablation result shows that the transformer encoder is beneficial for detecting each characteristic waveform. To assess the generalization ability of the method, it was also evaluated on inter-patient datasets with different types of cardiac diseases, and experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method is effective for all of them. Significance: The proposed method applies the transformer encoder to the detection of ECG characteristic waveforms for the first time and achieves competitive performance. © 2022;Characteristic wave delineation--CNN--Deep learning--ECG--ECT-net--Transformer;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Diseases--Physiological models--Seismic waves--Signal detection--Signal encoding--Characteristic wave delineation--Characteristic waveforms--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Detection methods--ECT-net--Electrocardiogram signal--P waves--T waves--Transformer--Article--autoencoder--China--comparative study--convolutional neural network--data base--deep learning--electrocardiogram--embedding--feature extraction--heart beat--heart disease--human--machine learning--P wave--QRS amplitude--spatial analysis--T wave--transformer--waveform--Electrocardiograms;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85142747367

Regular monitoring of the arterial pulse is one of the possible solutions, however, existing technologies have put limitations, due instability in continuous monitoring, lack of information in real-time recording of cardiovascular parameters and bulky instruments. A highly sensitive flexible piezoelectric sensor of nylon-11 fabricated is introduced from simple solution processable technique. Which consists of a highly sensitive, flexible, conformable piezoelectric film, owing to its high mechanosensitivity (≈225 mV N−1) in the subtle pressure range (0.001–1 kPa), and fast responsivity (≈4 ms), it is tested for assessing risk factors of cardiovascular diseases based on arterial pulse data. It is integrated with the internet of things (IoT) via system on a chip to facilitate remote healthcare monitoring. Deep learning algorithms is further interfaced with sensor for early detect and predict cardiovascular risks, showing an accuracy of >94% for predicting cardiovascular status. This piezoelectric sensor equipped with artificial intelligence and IoT has potential for monitoring the risk analysis of the cardiovascular diseases, daily activities, and facilitate to early predict the anomalous physiological changes in the body. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.;cardiovascular diseases--deep learning neural networks--machine learning--nylon-11--piezoelectricity;Cardiology--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Electric sensing devices--Forecasting--Internet of things--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Piezoelectric transducers--Rayon--Risk analysis--Risk assessment--System-on-chip--Arterial pulse--Cardiovascular disease--Causes of death--Continuous monitoring--Deep learning neural network--Learning neural networks--Machine-learning--Nylon 11--Piezoelectric sensors--Solution processable--Piezoelectricity;John Wiley and Sons Inc;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85147527083

Examples include high blood pressure, ischaemia, irregular heartbeats and pericardial effusion. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal analysis is frequently used to diagnose heart diseases, providing crucial information on how the heart functions. To analyse ECG signals, quantile graphs (QGs) is a method that maps a time series into a network based on the time-series fluctuation proprieties. Here, we demonstrate that the QG methodology can differentiate younger and older patients. Furthermore, we construct networks from the QG method and use machine-learning algorithms to perform the automatic diagnosis, obtaining high accuracy. Indeed, we verify that this method can automatically detect changes in the ECG of elderly and young subjects, with the highest classification performance for the adjacency matrix with a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve close to one. The findings reported here confirm the QG method's utility in deciphering intricate, nonlinear signals like those produced by patient ECGs. Furthermore, we find a more significant, more connected and lower distribution of information networks associated with the networks from ECG data of the elderly compared with younger subjects. Finally, this methodology can be applied to other ECG data related to other diseases, such as ischaemia.  © 2023 The Author(s).;Complex Networks--Deep learning--Electrocardiogram--Machine Learning--Network Measures--Time Series;Blood pressure--Cardiology--Complex networks--Deep learning--Diseases--Heart--Information services--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Time series analysis--Cardiovascular disease--Condition--Deep learning--Electrocardiogram signal--Graph methods--Heart disease--Ischaemia--Machine-learning--Network measures--Times series--Electrocardiograms;Oxford University Press;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85172693339

Machine learning (ML) models have been used for automated MI detection on ECG signals. Deep learning models generally yield high classification performance but are computationally intensive. We have developed a novel multilevel hybrid feature extraction-based classification model with low time complexity for MI classification. The study dataset comprising 12-lead ECGs belonging to one healthy and 10 MI classes were downloaded from a public ECG signal databank. The model architecture comprised multilevel hybrid feature extraction, iterative feature selection, classification, and iterative majority voting (IMV). In the hybrid handcrafted feature (HHF) generation phase, both textural and statistical feature extraction functions were used to extract features from ECG beats but only at a low level. A new pooling-based multilevel decomposition model was presented to enable them to create features at a high level. This model used average and maximum pooling to create decomposed signals. Using these pooling functions, an unbalanced tree was obtained. Therefore, this model was named multilevel unbalanced pooling tree transformation (MUPTT). On the feature extraction side, two extractors (functions) were used to generate both statistical and textural features. To generate statistical features, 20 commonly used moments were used. A new, improved symmetric binary pattern function was proposed to generate textural features. Both feature extractors were applied to the original MI signal and the decomposed signals generated by the MUPTT. The most valuable features from among the extracted feature vectors were selected using iterative neighborhood component analysis (INCA). In the classification phase, a one-dimensional nearest neighbor classifier with ten-fold cross-validation was used to obtain lead-wise results. The computed lead-wise results derived from all 12 leads of the same beat were input to the IMV algorithm to generate ten voted results. The most representative was chosen using a greedy technique to calculate the overall classification performance of the model. The HHF-MUPTT-based ECG beat classification model attained excellent performance, with the best lead-wise accuracy of 99.85% observed in Lead III and 99.94% classification accuracy using the IMV algorithm. The results confirmed the high MI classification ability of the presented computationally lightweight HHF-MUPTT-based model. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.;ECG signal processing--Local binary pattern--MI classification--Statistical feature extraction;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Deep learning--Extraction--Feature extraction--Forestry--Graphic methods--Heart--Iterative methods--Lead compounds--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Local binary pattern--Classification performance--Electrocardiography signal processing--Local binary patterns--Multilevels--Myocardial Infarction--Myocardial infarction classification--Signal-processing--Statistical feature extractions--Textural feature--Tree transformation--Electrocardiography;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85142716886

AI can assist in analysing complex data, interpreting medical images, and providing personalised nutrition interventions for patients. Clinical nutrition is a critical aspect of patient care, and AI can help clinicians make more informed decisions regarding patients' nutritional requirements, disease prevention, and management. AI algorithms can analyse large datasets to identify novel associations between diet and disease outcomes, enabling clinicians to make evidence-based nutritional recommendations. AI-powered devices and applications can also assist in tracking dietary intake, providing feedback, and motivating patients towards healthier food choices. However, the adoption of AI in clinical nutrition raises several ethical and regulatory concerns, such as data privacy and bias. Further research is needed to assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of AI-powered nutrition interventions.

Digital healthcare research is being conducted on many conditions including shock. However, the causes of shock are diverse, and the treatment is very complicated, requiring a high level of medical knowledge. In this paper, we propose a shock detection method based on the correlation between shock and data extracted from hemodynamic monitoring equipment. From the various parameters expressed by this equipment, four parameters closely related to patient shock were used as the input data for a machine learning model in order to detect the shock. Using the four parameters as input data, that is, feature values, a random forest-based ensemble machine learning model was constructed. The value of the mean arterial pressure was used as the correct answer value, the so called label value, to detect the patient's shock state. The performance was then compared with the decision tree and logistic regression model using a confusion matrix. The average accuracy of the random forest model was 92.80%, which shows superior performance compared to other models. We look forward to our work playing a role in helping medical staff by making recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of complex and difficult cases of shock.  © 2023 KSII.;Artificial intelligence--Digital healthcare--MAP--Random forest--Shock patient;Blood pressure--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diagnosis--E-learning--Health care--Input output programs--Learning systems--Logistic regression--Digital healthcare--Digital technologies--Input datas--Learning models--Machine learning models--Performance--Random forests--Shock detections--Shock patient--Telemedicine services--Decision trees;Korean Society for Internet Information;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85164949984

This review aims to summarize the recent ML approaches for automatically interpreting standard 12-lead ECG signals. Methods: We searched 10 indexing databases, for original research in English, referring to the application of ML/DL techniques in 12-lead, raw ECG signal analysis. The retrieved titles were filtered based on their relevance. The results were summarized and reported. Key Content and Findings: More than 80% of studies integrated a DL approach, while fewer attempts applied a feature extraction method to obtain inputs for training a simple ML classifier. The average diagnostic accuracy was as high as 90%, while several other performance metrics, such as the area under the curve (AUC), F1-score, sensitivity and specificity, were also employed. DL models generally demanded 10-time more samples for training but were capable of better handling multi-class problems. The most frequently involved disease (49% of studies) was myocardial infarction (MI), while atrial fibrillation (AF) was encountered in more than one-third of studies. Various datasets were used for training and testing, constituting either private collections or publicly available databanks [such as the “Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt” (PTB) dataset and datasets derived from the “China Physiological Signal Challenge” and the “Computing in Cardiology Challenge”]. Overall, DL and simpler ML approaches for automated ECG interpretation display unprecedented growth, reaching remarkably high performances. Conclusions: While such novel tools can support clinicians in reaching reliable diagnoses for life-threatening conditions on the spot, concerns regarding their accountability do exist. Generalizability of the developed approaches is still an issue, possibly mitigable with the extensive deployment of developed models, so as to become massively accessible and validatable. Finally, the observed heterogeneity of the various attempts underlines the need for transparency and reproducibility in the development processes. © Journal of Medical Artificial Intelligence.

It is a painless method that mimics the cyclical contraction and relaxation of the heart’s muscles. By monitoring the heart’s electrical activity, an ECG can be used to identify irregular heartbeats, heart attacks, cardiac illnesses, or enlarged hearts. Numerous studies and analyses of ECG signals to identify cardiac problems have been conducted during the past few years. Although ECG heartbeat classification methods have been presented in the literature, especially for unbalanced datasets, they have not proven to be successful in recognizing some heartbeat categories with high performance. This study uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to combine the benefits of dense and residual blocks. The objective is to leverage the benefits of residual and dense connections to enhance information flow, gradient propagation, and feature reuse, ultimately improving the model’s performance. This proposed model consists of a series of residual-dense blocks interleaved with optional pooling layers for downsampling. A linear support vector machine (LSVM) classified heartbeats into five classes. This makes it easier to learn and represent features from ECG signals. We first denoised the gathered ECG data to correct issues such as baseline drift, power line interference, and motion noise. The impacts of the class imbalance are then offset by resampling techniques that denoise ECG signals. An RD-CNN algorithm is then used to categorize the ECG data for the various cardiac illnesses using the retrieved characteristics. On two benchmarked datasets, we conducted extensive simulations and assessed several performance measures. On average, we have achieved an accuracy of 98.5%, a sensitivity of 97.6%, a specificity of 96.8%, and an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.99. The effectiveness of our suggested method for detecting heart disease from ECG data was compared with several recently presented algorithms. The results demonstrate that our method is lightweight and practical, qualifying it for continuous monitoring applications in clinical settings for automated ECG interpretation to support cardiologists. © 2023 by the authors.;cardiac health--convolutional neural--deep learning--electrocardiogram (ECG)--feature extraction--heart disease detection--long-term short-term memory--residual blocks;Electrocardiography--Heart--Heart Diseases--Humans--Myocardial Infarction--Neural Networks, Computer--Backpropagation--Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Feature extraction--Heart--Network architecture--Signal analysis--Support vector machines--Cardiac health--Convolutional neural--Deep learning--Disease detection--Electrocardiogram--Features extraction--Heart disease--Heart disease detection--Long-term short-term memory--Residual block--Short term memory--artificial neural network--electrocardiography--heart--heart disease--heart infarction--human--Electrocardiograms;Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI);37631741;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85168732994

The use of ECG signals in screening for LV systolic dysfunction is limited by their availability to clinicians. We developed a novel deep learning-based approach that can use ECG images for the screening of LV systolic dysfunction. METHODS: Using 12-lead ECGs plotted in multiple different formats, and corresponding echocardiographic data recorded within 15 days from the Yale New Haven Hospital between 2015 and 2021, we developed a convolutional neural network algorithm to detect an LV ejection fraction <40%. The model was validated within clinical settings at Yale New Haven Hospital and externally on ECG images from Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA--Lake Regional Hospital in Osage Beach, MO--Memorial Hermann Southeast Hospital in Houston, TX--and Methodist Cardiology Clinic of San Antonio, TX. In addition, it was validated in the prospective Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping was used to localize class-discriminating signals on ECG images. RESULTS: Overall, 385 601 ECGs with paired echocardiograms were used for model development. The model demonstrated high discrimination across various ECG image formats and calibrations in internal validation (area under receiving operation characteristics [AUROCs], 0.91--area under precision-recall curve [AUPRC], 0.55)--and external sets of ECG images from Cedars Sinai (AUROC, 0.90 and AUPRC, 0.53), outpatient Yale New Haven Hospital clinics (AUROC, 0.94 and AUPRC, 0.77), Lake Regional Hospital (AUROC, 0.90 and AUPRC, 0.88), Memorial Hermann Southeast Hospital (AUROC, 0.91 and AUPRC 0.88), Methodist Cardiology Clinic (AUROC, 0.90 and AUPRC, 0.74), and Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health cohort (AUROC, 0.95 and AUPRC, 0.45). An ECG suggestive of LV systolic dysfunction portended >27-fold higher odds of LV systolic dysfunction on transthoracic echocardiogram (odds ratio, 27.5 [95% CI, 22.3-33.9] in the held-out set). Class-discriminative patterns localized to the anterior and anteroseptal leads (V2 and V3), corresponding to the left ventricle regardless of the ECG layout. A positive ECG screen in individuals with an LV ejection fraction ≥40% at the time of initial assessment was associated with a 3.9-fold increased risk of developing incident LV systolic dysfunction in the future (hazard ratio, 3.9 [95% CI, 3.3-4.7]--median follow-up, 3.2 years). CONCLUSIONS: We developed and externally validated a deep learning model that identifies LV systolic dysfunction from ECG images. This approach represents an automated and accessible screening strategy for LV systolic dysfunction, particularly in low-resource settings. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Early prediction of CVD's can help in reducing the complications of high-risk patients. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an efficient aiding tool, provides accurate information about various cardiac conditions of the human heart. Evaluation and interpretation of ECG signal has become the major goal in current research to identify and mitigate risky cardiovascular conditions. The ECG signal is efficiently analysed and classified using signal processing techniques, ranging from traditional to machine learning approaches and its subbranches, such as deep learning are used for the early detection and diagnosis of cardiac conditions and arrhythmias. The development of novel types of body sensors increases the need for automated, low-cost, real-time, and efficient ECG monitoring systems that can be used at home or in ambulatory settings. IoT in healthcare industry enables the doctors and specialists to diagnose the patient status remotely in a smart and efficient manner. Motivated with all the research done in this area for early diagnosis of cardiac abnormalities and save the life of high-risk patients, we surveyed numerous research works reported in the literature and provide a glance on several aspects of ECG signal monitoring systems. We first introduce the step-by-step framework of ECG signal analysis starting data acquisition to classification, describes each stage analysis of both traditional and advanced machine learning models that have been reported in the literature. We provide a deep discussion on ECG signal acquisition, pre-recorded clinical ECG data taken from the databases, signal processing and denoising, detection of feature based on feature engineering, and signal classification along with the comparative assessment amongst reviewed studies. This work also presents the detailed analysis of smart health care system that employs portable and wearable devices, as well as the Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless technologies, as an innovative medium for data transmission that allows for remote access to a patient's health status at lower costs and with greater efficiency. Moreover, this work provides an extensive knowledge on various hardware platforms that have been adopted for the development of biomedical processors including microcontrollers, FPGA and ASIC. Additionally, the challenges and limitations are discussed in this research field and directions for future work are suggested. This is the first review paper of its kind to present a comprehensive discussion on all aspects of cardiovascular disease monitoring systems in one place. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd;Biomedical processors--Classification--Deep learning--Feature engineering--Internet of Things--Machine learning--Wearable devices;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Cost benefit analysis--Data acquisition--Deep learning--Diseases--Health care--Heart--Internet of things--Real time systems--Wearable technology--Biomedical processor--Cardiovascular disease--Condition--Deep learning--Electrocardiogram signal--Feature engineerings--High-risk patients--Machine-learning--Monitoring system--Wearable devices--Electrocardiograms;Elsevier Ltd;;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85146910997

Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a radiomics and machine learning–based analysis of 18F-FDG PET/CT (PET-ML) as a major criterion for the European Society of Cardiology score using machine learning as a major imaging criterion (ESC-ML) in PVE diagnosis. The secondary objective was to assess performance of PET-ML as a standalone examination. Methods: All 18F-FDG-PET/CT scans performed for suspected aortic PVE at a single center from 2015 to 2021 were retrospectively included. The gold standard was expert consensus after at least 3 months’ follow-up. The machine learning (ML) method consisted of manually segmenting each prosthetic valve, extracting 31 radiomics features from the segmented region, and training a ridge logistic regressor to predict PVE. Training and hyperparameter tuning were done with a cross-validation approach, followed by an evaluation on an independent test database. Results: A total of 108 patients were included, regardless of myocardial uptake, and were divided into training (n = 68) and test (n = 40) cohorts. Considering the latter, PET-ML findings were positive for 13 of 22 definite PVE cases and 3 of 18 rejected PVE cases (59% sensitivity, 83% specificity), thus leading to an ESC-ML sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 83%. Conclusions: The use of ML for analyzing 18F-FDG-PET/CT images in PVE diagnosis was feasible and beneficial, particularly when ML was included in the ESC 2015 criteria. Despite some limitations and the need for future developments, this approach seems promising to optimize the role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in PVE diagnosis. © 2023 American College of Cardiology Foundation;artificial intelligence--endocarditis--FDG--PET;Endocarditis--Endocarditis, Bacterial--Fluorodeoxyglucose F18--Heart Valve Prosthesis--Humans--Machine Learning--Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography--Predictive Value of Tests--Radiopharmaceuticals--Retrospective Studies--antibiotic agent--C reactive protein--fluorodeoxyglucose f 18--fluorodeoxyglucose f 18--radiopharmaceutical agent--aged--antibiotic therapy--Article--artificial intelligence--blood culture--Charlson Comorbidity Index--cohort analysis--computer assisted tomography--contrast enhancement--controlled study--cross validation--deep learning--diagnostic test accuracy study--echocardiography--female--follow up--gold standard--human--image analysis--infective endocarditis--leave one out cross validation--machine learning--major clinical study--male--ordered subset expectation maximization--point spread function--positron emission tomography--positron emission tomography-computed tomography--prosthetic valve endocarditis--qualitative analysis--quantitative analysis--radiomics--reliability--retrospective study--sensitivity and specificity--standardized uptake value--Staphylococcus aureus--training--transcatheter aortic valve implantation--bacterial endocarditis--diagnostic imaging--endocarditis--machine learning--predictive value--procedures;Elsevier Inc.;37052569;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85153871700

This is broadly employed in heart disease detection including arrhythmia. Arrhythmia is a general term for abnormal heart rhythms that can be identified and classified into many categories. Automatic ECG analysis is provided by arrhythmia categorization in cardiac patient monitoring systems. It aids cardiologists to diagnose the ECG signal. In this work, an Ensemble classifier is proposed for accurate arrhythmia detection using ECG Signal. Input data are taken from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset. Then the input data was pre-processed using Python in Jupyter Notebook which run the code in an isolated manner and was able to keep code, formula, comments, and images. Then, Residual Exemplars Local Binary Pattern is applied for extracting statistical features. The extracted features are given to ensemble classifiers, like Support vector machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and random forest (RF) for classifying the arrhythmia as normal (N), supraventricular ectopic beat (S), ventricular ectopic beat (V), fusion beat (F), and unknown beat (Q). The proposed AD-Ensemble SVM-NB-RF method is implemented in Python. The proposed AD-Ensemble SVM-NB-RF method is 44.57%, 52.41%, and 29.49% higher accuracy--2.01%, 3.33%, and 3.19% higher area under the curve (AUC)--and 21.52%, 23.05%, and 12.68% better F-Measure compared with existing models, like multi-model depending on the ensemble of deep learning for ECG heartbeats arrhythmia categorization (AD-Ensemble CNN-LSTM-RRHOS), ECG signal categorization utilizing VGGNet: a neural network based classification method (AD-Ensemble CNN-LSTM) and higher performance arrhythmic heartbeat categorization utilizing ensemble learning along PSD based feature extraction method (AD-Ensemble MLP-NB-RF).

Accurate classification of cardiovascular diseases is an important research topic in healthcare. During COVID-19, auscultating heart sounds was challenging as health workers and doctors wear protective clothing, and direct contact with patients can spread the outbreak. Thus, contactless auscultation of heart sound is necessary. In this paper, a low-cost ear contactless stethoscope is designed where auscultation is done with the help of a bluetooth-enabled micro speaker instead of an earpiece. The PCG recordings are further compared with other standard electronic stethoscopes like Littman 3 M. This work is made to improve the performance of deep learning-based classifiers like recurrent neural networks (RNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for different valvular heart problems using tuning of hyperparameters like learning rate of optimizers, dropout rate, and hidden layer. Hyper-parameter tuning is used to optimize the performances of various deep learning models and their learning curves for real-time analysis. The acoustic, time, and frequency domain features are used in this research. The investigation is made on the heart sounds of normal and diseased patients available from the standard data repository to train the software models. The proposed CNN-based inception network model achieved an accuracy of 99.65 ± 0.06% on the test dataset with a sensitivity of 98.8 ± 0.05% and specificity of 98.2 ± 0.19%. The proposed hybrid CNN-RNN architecture attained 91.17 ± 0.03% accuracy on test data after hyperparameter optimization, whereas the LSTM-based RNN model achieved 82.32 ± 0.11% accuracy. Finally, the evaluated results were compared with machine learning algorithms, and the improved CNN-based Inception Net model is the most effective among others.

When the kidneys fail to effectively eliminate waste from the bloodstream, it sets off a gradual deterioration of kidney function, ultimately resulting in renal disease. This paper aims to develop a novel hybrid classifier to improve the accuracy of renal disease prediction on a dataset collected from one of the reputed hospitals in India. In this study, a methodology was employed to develop two hybrid classifiers: Random Subspace and Bagging. These hybrid classifiers were constructed using six individual classifiers, namely K-nearest neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, two-class locally deep Support Vector Machines, two-class Averaged Perceptron, and two-class Bayes Point Machine Algorithms. The performance evaluation of the classifiers was conducted using 10-fold cross-validation, with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and Kappa as the evaluation metrics. The dataset used in this study was collected from a reputable hospital in India and comprised 650 records with 13 attributes. To address missing values within the dataset, the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) imputation technique was employed. Hybrid classifiers outperform individual classifiers, particularly in the case of hybrid random subspaces combined with two-class locally deep Support Vector Machines. This hybrid approach achieved a remarkable accuracy of 100%, surpassing other random subspace hybrid classifiers and bagging classifiers. The findings of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of hybrid random subspaces in conjunction with two-class locally deep Support Vector Machine models for enhancing the accuracy of renal disease prediction. © 2023 IEEE.;Bagging--Chronic Kidney Disease--KNN imputation--Machine learning--Random Subspaces--Renal disease;Blood pressure--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Deterioration--Diseases--Forecasting--Hospitals--Motion compensation--Nearest neighbor search--Vectors--Bagging--Chronic kidney disease--Hybrid classifier--Individual classifiers--Kidney function--KNN imputation--Machine-learning--Random subspaces--Renal disease--Support vectors machine--Support vector machines;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85186749307

Because of this complication, there is a significant level of curiosity among many diagnostic healthcare professionals and researchers who are keenly interested in the efficient, accurate, and early-stage forecasting of heart disease. Deep Learning Algorithms aid in the prediction of heart disease. The main focus of this paper is to develop a method for predicting heart disease through Modified Rough K means + + (MRK + +) clustering along with the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). This paper is categorized into two modules: (1) Propose a clustering component based on Modified Rough K-means + +--(2) disease prediction based on RBM. The input Cleveland dataset is clustered using the stochastic probabilistic rough k-means + + clustering technique in the module for clustering. The clustered data is acquired and used in the RBM, and this hybrid structure is then used in the heart disease forecasting module. Throughout the testing procedure, the most valid result is chosen from the clustered test data, and the RBM classifier that correlates to the nearest cluster in the test data is based on the smallest distance or similar parameters. Furthermore, the output value is used to predict heart disease. There are three different types of experiments that are performed: In the first experiment comprises modifying the rough K-means + + clustering algorithm, the second experiment evaluates the classification result, and the third experiment suggests hybrid model representation. When the Hybrid Modified Rough k-means + + - RBM model is compared with any single model, it provides the highest accuracy.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.;Classification--Clustering--Heart disease--Hybrid modified RoughK-means + +--K-means + + algorithm--Restricted Boltzmann machine--Rough set;Cardiology--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Forecasting--Stochastic systems--Clinical diagnosis--Clusterings--Heart disease--Hybrid modified roughk-mean + +--K-mean algorithms--Machine modelling--Restricted boltzmann machine--Rough K-means--Rough set--Test data--K-means clustering;World Scientific;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85161216803

Artificial intelligence techniques ranging from machine learning to deep learning are prevalent in healthcare for disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and patient risk identification. Numerous medical data sources are required to perfectly diagnose diseases using artificial intelligence techniques, such as ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, mammography, genomics, computed tomography scan, etc. Furthermore, artificial intelligence primarily enhanced the infirmary experience and sped up preparing patients to continue their rehabilitation at home. This article covers the comprehensive survey based on artificial intelligence techniques to diagnose numerous diseases such as Alzheimer, cancer, diabetes, chronic heart disease, tuberculosis, stroke and cerebrovascular, hypertension, skin, and liver disease. We conducted an extensive survey including the used medical imaging dataset and their feature extraction and classification process for predictions. Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines are used to select the articles published up to October 2020 on the Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, Excerpta Medical Database, and Psychology Information for early prediction of distinct kinds of diseases using artificial intelligence-based techniques.

Heart sound signals are promising in the preliminary diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Previous studies have focused on capturing the local characteristics of heart sounds. In this paper, we investigate a method for mapping heart sound signals with complex patterns to fixed-length feature embedding called HS-Vectors for abnormal heart sound detection. To get the full embedding of the complex heart sound, HS-Vectors are obtained through the Time-Compressed and Frequency-Expanded Time-Delay Neural Network(TCFE-TDNN) and the Dynamic Masked-Attention (DMA) module. HS-Vectors extract and utilize the global and critical heart sound characteristics by masking out irreverent information. Based on the TCFE-TDNN module, the heart sound signal within a certain time is projected into fixed-length embedding. Then, with a learnable mask attention matrix, DMA stats pooling aggregates multi-scale hidden features from different TCFE-TDNN layers and masks out irrelevant frame-level features. Experimental evaluations are performed on a 10-fold cross-validation task using the 2016 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge dataset and the new publicly available pediatric heart sound dataset we collected. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method excels the state-of-the-art models in abnormality detection.  © 2013 IEEE.;Abnormal heart sound detection--Dynamic Masked-Attention statistics pooling--HS-vectors--Time-Compressed and Frequency-Expanded Time-Delay Neural Network;Aggregates--Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Complex networks--Data mining--Diagnosis--Diseases--Feature extraction--Heart--Neural networks--Time delay--Abnormal heart sound detection--Dynamic masked-attention statistic pooling--Features extraction--Heart sounds--HS-vector--Sound detection--Task analysis--Time delay neural networks--Time-compressed and frequency-expanded time-delay neural network--Time-frequency Analysis--abnormal heart sound--aortic stenosis--Article--artificial neural network--classification algorithm--convolutional neural network--cross validation--data processing--deep learning--dynamic masked attention--embedding--Fallot tetralogy--feature extraction--frequency analysis--heart atrium septum defect--heart rate variability--heart sound--heart ventricle septum defect--hidden Markov model--image segmentation--learning algorithm--masking--measurement accuracy--mitral valve regurgitation--phonocardiography--pulmonary valve stenosis--recurrent neural network--sensitivity and specificity--signal processing--sound detection--support vector machine--time compressed and frequency expanded time delay neural network--time delay neural network--wavelet transform--Vectors;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85144763428

In addition to clinical diagnosis, machine learning and deep learning-based approaches are vital in the diagnosis of heart disease. Method: This paper proposes a balanced and optimized machine-learning algorithm for heart disease detection. This technique combines oversampling techniques, attribute pruning, CART decision tree classifier, and rule pruning through hyper-parameter tuning to identify the presence of heart disease. It further identifies the key attributes that contribute to the occurrence of heart malfunctioning. Results: Experimental results show that SMOTE sampled dataset exhibits effective performance when implemented using a balanced and optimized machine learning algorithm, with an improvement of 11%, 75%, 62%, and 71% in accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 scores when compared with the dataset that was not subjected to sampling. The algorithm works effectively when the imbalance ratio is high for a dataset. Conclusion: The algorithm can be used to predict the presence of heart disease even in highly imbalanced datasets and identify critical features in the malfunctioning of the heart. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Brazilian Society of Biomedical Engineering.;BOML--decision tree--heart disease--machine learning--oversampling;Cardiology--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Heart--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--BOML--Clinical diagnosis--Decision tree classifiers--Disease detection--Heart disease--Human being--Learning-based approach--Machine learning algorithms--Machine-learning--Over sampling--Decision trees;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85144871064

It might be the beginning of a field of heart behavior analysis focused on sex. However, a person’s heartbeat changes during daily activities, which could compromise the classification. In this paper, with the intention of capturing heartbeat dynamics, we divided the heart rate into different intervals, creating a specialized identification model for each interval. The sexual differentiation for each model was performed with a deep convolutional neural network from images that represented the RGB wavelet transformation of ECG pseudo-orthogonal X, Y, and Z signals, using sufficient samples to train the network. Our database included 202 people, with a female-to-male population ratio of 49.5–50.5% and an observation period of 24 h per person. As our main goal, we looked for periods of time during which the classification rate of sex recognition was higher and the process was faster--in fact, we identified intervals in which only one heartbeat was required. We found that for each heart rate interval, the best accuracy score varied depending on the number of heartbeats collected. Furthermore, our findings indicated that as the heart rate increased, fewer heartbeats were needed for analysis. On average, our proposed model reached an accuracy of 94.82% ± 1.96%. The findings of this investigation provide a heartbeat acquisition procedure for ECG sex recognition systems. In addition, our results encourage future research to include sex as a soft biometric characteristic in person identification scenarios and for cardiology studies, in which the detection of specific male or female anomalies could help autonomous learning machines move toward specialized health applications. © 2023 by the authors.;ECG--machine learning--sex recognition--smartphone applications--soft biometrics--user authentication;Authentication--Biometrics--Convolutional neural networks--Deep neural networks--Heart--Image classification--Learning systems--Electrocardiogram signal--Heart-rate--Images classification--Machine-learning--Neural-networks--RGB images--Sex recognition--Smart-phone applications--Soft biometrics--User authentication--Electrocardiograms;MDPI;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85163781038

Heart disease will affect the muscles, valves or heart rate, and bypass surgery or coronary artery surgery will be used to treat these problems. In this paper, UCI heart disease dataset and real time dataset are used to test the deep learning techniques which are compared with the traditional methods. To improve the accuracy of the traditional methods, cluster-based bi-directional long-short term memory (C-BiLSTM) has been proposed. The UCI and real time heart disease dataset are used for experimental results, and both the datasets are used as inputs through the K-Means clustering algorithm for the removal of duplicate data, and then, the heart disease has been predicted using C-BiLSTM approach. The conventional classifier methods such as Regression Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, Gated Recurrent Unit and Ensemble are compared with C-BiLSTM, and the efficiency of the system is demonstrated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and F1 score. The results show that the C-BiLSTM proves to be the best with 94.78% accuracy of UCI dataset and 92.84% of real time dataset compared to the six conventional methods for providing better prediction of heart disease. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.;BiLSTM--Heart disease--K- means clustering--Performance metrics--Prediction;Blood vessels--Cardiology--Diseases--Heart--K-means clustering--Long short-term memory--Statistical tests--Support vector machines--Surgery--Bi-directional--BiLSTM--Chest pain--Cluster-based--Heart attack--Heart disease--Heart-rate--K-means++ clustering--Performance metrices--Real-time dataset--Forecasting;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85126837837

Its recording is the phonocardiogram (PCG). Pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease (CHD-PAH) is a serious heart disease and is often associated with severe disability and death. The disease is not well characterized onset. The most patients are severe when they have been diagnosed and miss the best time to treat them. The objective of this study was to develop a computer aided diagnosis, which based on single cycle with multiple features, for detecting pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease. It is a non-invasive and simple method which may be hopeful at early diagnosis of CHD-PAH. The original heart sounds were pre-processed first, in which a double-threshold adaptive segmentation method was used to segment the signal into each cardiac cycle first. Then the time–frequency domain features and wavelet packet energy features of cardiac cycle and S2 component are extracted. And convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract the depth features of cardiac cycle. The above features were combined into a fused feature vector. Normal, CHD and CHD-PAH were classified using XGBoost as the classifier. Finally, the majority voting algorithm is used to obtain the best classification result for multiple results corresponding to multiple cardiac cycles of the same person.

It is a non-invasive technique that represents the cyclic contraction and relaxation of heart muscles. ECG can be used to detect abnormal heart motions, heart attacks, heart diseases, or enlarged hearts by measuring the heart's electrical activity. Over the past few years, various works have been done in the field of studying and analyzing the ECG signals to detect heart diseases. In this work, we propose a deep learning and fuzzy clustering (Fuzz-ClustNet) based approach for Arrhythmia detection from ECG signals. We started by denoising the collected ECG signals to remove errors like baseline drift, power line interference, motion noise, etc. The denoised ECG signals are then segmented to have an increased focus on the ECG signals. We then perform data augmentation on the segmented images to counter the effects of the class imbalance. The augmented images are then passed through a CNN feature extractor. The extracted features are then passed to a fuzzy clustering algorithm to classify the ECG signals for their respective cardio diseases. We ran intensive simulations on two benchmarked datasets and evaluated various performance metrics. The performance of our proposed algorithm was compared with several recently proposed algorithms for heart disease detection from ECG signals. The obtained results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach as compared to other contemporary algorithms. © 2023 The Author(s);Arrhythmia detection--Convolutional Neural Network--Deep learning--Electrocardiogram (ECG)--Feature extraction--Fuzzy clustering;Algorithms--Arrhythmias, Cardiac--Electrocardiography--Heart Rate--Humans--Myocardial Infarction--Neural Networks, Computer--Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted--Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Clustering algorithms--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Feature extraction--Fuzzy clustering--Fuzzy inference--Fuzzy neural networks--Heart--Signal detection--Arrhythmia detection--Cardiovascular disease--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Electrocardiogram--Electrocardiogram signal--Features extraction--Heart disease--Heart muscles--Noninvasive technique--Article--Bayesian learning--comparative study--computer assisted diagnosis--computer language--computer simulation--controlled study--convolutional neural network--decision tree--deep learning--deep neural network--diagnostic accuracy--electrocardiogram--electrocardiography--feature extraction--fuzzy clustering--heart arrhythmia--heart ventricle extrasystole--human--image processing--image segmentation--k means clustering--k nearest neighbor--kernel method--logistic regression analysis--low frequency noise--machine learning--noise reduction--random forest--signal processing--support vector machine--supraventricular premature beat--algorithm--diagnostic imaging--heart arrhythmia--heart infarction--heart rate--Electrocardiograms;Elsevier Ltd;36608461;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85145648584

Abnormal heart rate signals are an important indicator of cardiovascular disease. At present, the ECG signal acquisition instruments on the market are not portable and manual analysis is applied in data processing, which cannot address the above problems. To solve these problems, this study proposes an ECG acquisition and analysis system based on machine learning. The ECG analysis system responsible for ECG signal classification includes two parts: data preprocessing and machine learning models. Multiple types of models were built for overall classification, and model fusion was conducted. Firstly, traditional models such as logistic regression, support vector machines, and XGBoost were employed, along with feature engineering that primarily included morphological features and wavelet coefficient features. Subsequently, deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks, were introduced and utilized for model fusion classification. The system’s classification accuracy for ECG signals reached 99.13%. Future work will focus on optimizing the model and developing a more portable instrument that can be utilized in the field. © 2023 by the authors.;CNN--ECG--electrocardiogram--machine learning--model fusion;Cardiovascular Diseases--Engineering--Humans--Machine Learning--Memory, Long-Term--Systems Analysis--Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Convolutional neural networks--Data handling--Deep learning--Diseases--Learning systems--Logistic regression--Support vector machines--Acquisition systems--Analysis system--Cardiovascular disease--Causes of death--ECG signals--Machine-learning--Model fusion--On-machines--Signal acquisitions--Signals analysis--cardiovascular disease--engineering--human--long term memory--machine learning--system analysis--Electrocardiograms;Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI);37688099;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85170344620

It is a group of conditions that includes heart failure and other cardiac problems. In the USA, there are an estimated 356,000 cases of hospital cardiac arrest every year, 90% of which are fatal, as reported by the American Heart Association (Tsao et al. in Circulation https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001052 , 2022). However, the survival rate may be improved by routine monitoring of cardiac function in order to detect the illness at an early stage. Many formerly intractable medical issues have made significant progress because of the combination of computer technology and biomedical research. Automatic prediction is made possible by the examination of previously learned data in machine learning. In this research, we utilize the Physionet Cinc/C Challenge 2016 Phonocardiogram dataset. Classification models like K-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and AlexNet are used with the features retrieved using wavelet scattering transform and continuous wavelet transform. The primary objective of this work is to provide a very effective method for early diagnosis of cardiovascular disorders, which will help clinical professionals better spot heart issues in their patients. Sensitivity, Specificity and other performance metrics are used to assess the effectiveness of the various categorization models. KNN, SVM, and AlexNet classifiers all achieve good accuracy with AlexNet outperforms the former two giving an accuracy of 98.11%, with a sensitivity of 96.20% and a specificity of 98.73%. Our suggested model’s output has the potential to contribute significantly to the categorization of cardiac sounds. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.;Alexnet--Cardiovascular disease--K-nearest neighbour--Phonocardiogram--Support vector machine;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Heart--Nearest neighbor search--Phonocardiography--Wavelet transforms--Alexnet--Cardiac arrest--Cardiovascular disease--Condition--Heart disease--Heart failure--K-near neighbor--Nearest-neighbour--Phonocardiograms--Support vectors machine--Support vector machines;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85163739990

Diagnosing cardiac illness is a difficult endeavor that necessitates both expertise and extensive knowledge. Machine learning (ML) is becoming gradually more important in the medical field. Most of the works have concentrated on the prediction of cardiac disease, however the precision of the results is minimal, and data integrity is uncertain. To solve these difficulties, this research creates an Integrated Accurate-Secure Heart Disease Prediction (IAS) Model based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. Heart-related medical data is collected and pre-processed. Secondly, feature extraction is processed with two factors, from signals and acquired data, which are further trained for classification. The Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) is used to categorize received sensor data as normal or abnormal. Furthermore, the results are safeguarded by implementing an integrity validation mechanism based on the hash algorithm. The system's performance is evaluated by comparing the proposed to existing models. The results explain that the proposed model-based cardiac disease diagnosis model surpasses previous techniques. The proposed method demonstrates that it attains accuracy of 98.5 % for the maximum amount of records, which is higher than available classifiers.

Prompt identification and recognization of myocardial ischemia/infarction (MI) is the most important goal in the management of acute coronary syndrome. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely used as the initial screening tool for patients with chest pain but its diagnostic accuracy remains limited. There is early evidence that machine learning (ML) algorithms applied to ECG waveforms can improve performance. Most studies are designed to classify MI from healthy controls and thus are limited due to the lack of consideration of ECG abnormalities from other cardiac conditions, leading to false positives. Moreover, clinical information beyond ECG has not yet been well leveraged in existing ML models. Approach. The present study considered downstream clinical implementation scenarios in the initial model design by dichotomizing study recordings from a public large-scale ECG dataset into a MI class and a non-MI class with the inclusion of MI-confounding conditions. Two experiments were conducted to systematically investigate the impact of two important factors entrained in the modeling process, including the duration of ECG, and the value of multimodal information for model training. A novel multimodal deep learning architecture was proposed to learn joint features from both ECG and patient demographics. Main results. The multimodal model achieved better performance than the ECG-only model, with a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 92.1% and a mean accuracy of 87.4%, which is on par with existing studies despite the increased task difficulty due to the new class definition. By investigation of model explainability, it revealed the contribution of patient information in model performance and clinical concordance of the model’s attention with existing clinical insights. Significance. The findings in this study help guide the development of ML solutions for prompt MI detection and move the models one step closer to real-world clinical applications. © 2023 The Author(s).

These developments include using deep learning (DL) for reducing the needed injected dose and acquisition time in perfusion acquisitions also due to DL improvements in image reconstruction and filtering, SPECT attenuation correction using DL without need for transmission images, DL and machine learning (ML) use for feature extraction to define myocardial left ventricular (LV) borders for functional measurements and improved detection of the LV valve plane and AI, ML, and DL implementations for MPI diagnosis, prognosis, and structured reporting. Although some have, most of these applications have yet to make it to widespread commercial distribution due to the recency of their developments, most reported in 2020. We must be prepared both technically and socio-economically to fully benefit from these and a tsunami of other AI applications that are coming. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korean Society of Nuclear Medicine.;Absolute myocardial blood flow--Artificial intelligence--Deep learning--Machine learning--Myocardial flow reserve--Nuclear cardiology;artificial intelligence--artificial neural network--cardiology--coronary artery disease--deep learning--health insurance--heart left ventricle--heart muscle blood flow--heart muscle perfusion--human--image reconstruction--image segmentation--left anterior descending coronary artery--machine learning--myocardial perfusion imaging--radiation dose--Review--single photon emission computed tomography;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85125424115

FC views intuitively depict the developmental morphology of the fetal heart. Early diagnosis of fetal CHD has always been the focus and difficulty of prenatal screening. Furthermore, deep learning technology has achieved great success in medical image analysis. Hence, applying deep learning technology in the early screening of fetal CHD helps improve diagnostic accuracy. However, the lack of large-scale and high-quality fetal FC views brings incredible difficulties to deep learning models or cardiologists. Hence, we propose a Pseudo-Siamese Feature Fusion Generative Adversarial Network (PSFFGAN), synthesizing high-quality fetal FC views using FC sketch images. In addition, we propose a novel Triplet Generative Adversarial Loss Function (TGALF), which optimizes PSFFGAN to fully extract the cardiac anatomical structure information provided by FC sketch images to synthesize the corresponding fetal FC views with speckle noises, artifacts, and other ultrasonic characteristics. The experimental results show that the fetal FC views synthesized by our proposed PSFFGAN have the best objective evaluation values: SSIM of 0.4627, MS-SSIM of 0.6224, and FID of 83.92, respectively. More importantly, two professional cardiologists evaluate healthy FC views and CHD FC views synthesized by our PSFFGAN, giving a subjective score that the average qualified rate is 82% and 79%, respectively, which further proves the effectiveness of the PSFFGAN.  © 2013 IEEE.;Congenital heart disease--deep learning--fetal four-chamber sketch images--fetal four-chamber views--GAN--images synthesis;Echocardiography--Female--Fetal Heart--Heart Defects, Congenital--Humans--Pregnancy--Prenatal Diagnosis--Ultrasonography, Prenatal--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Heart--Medical imaging--Speckle--Congenital heart disease--Deep learning--Deep) learning--Features extraction--Fetal four-chamber view--Fetal fourchamber sketch image--GAN--Generator--Images synthesis--Speckle--accuracy--algorithm--Article--artifact--cardiologist--congenital heart disease--convolutional neural network--deep learning--early diagnosis--feature extraction--fetus--fetus heart--human--image analysis--image quality--learning algorithm--loss of function mutation--machine learning--mathematical parameters--noise--prenatal screening--synthesis--training--ultrasound--congenital heart malformation--diagnostic imaging--echocardiography--female--fetus echography--pregnancy--prenatal diagnosis--procedures--Generative adversarial networks;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;35030088;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85123374390

We aimed to review the updated literature to outline the potential and caveats of using artificial intelligence–enabled electrocardiography (AIeECG) as an opportunistic screening tool for LVSD. We searched PubMed and Cochrane for variations of the terms “ECG,” “Heart Failure,” “systolic dysfunction,” and “Artificial Intelligence” from January 2010 to April 2022 and selected studies that reported the diagnostic accuracy and confounders of using AIeECG to detect LVSD. Out of 40 articles, we identified 15 relevant studies--eleven retrospective cohorts, three prospective cohorts, and one case series. Although various LVEF thresholds were used, AIeECG detected LVSD with a median AUC of 0.90 (IQR from 0.85 to 0.95), a sensitivity of 83.3% (IQR from 73 to 86.9%) and a specificity of 87% (IQR from 84.5 to 90.9%). AIeECG algorithms succeeded across a wide range of sex, age, and comorbidity and seemed especially useful in non-cardiology settings and when combined with natriuretic peptide testing. Furthermore, a false-positive AIeECG indicated a future development of LVSD. No studies investigated the effect on treatment or patient outcomes. This systematic review corroborates the arrival of a new generic biomarker, AIeECG, to improve the detection of LVSD. AIeECG, in addition to natriuretic peptides and echocardiograms, will improve screening for LVSD, but prospective randomized implementation trials with added therapy are needed to show cost-effectiveness and clinical significance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.;Artificial intelligence--Electrocardiogram--Left ventricular systolic dysfunction--Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction--Screening;Electrocardiography--Heart Failure--Humans--Intelligence--Prospective Studies--Retrospective Studies--Stroke Volume--Ventricular Dysfunction, Left--Ventricular Function, Left--biological marker--natriuretic factor--area under the curve--artificial intelligence--body mass--convolutional neural network--cost effectiveness analysis--data base--deep learning--diagnostic accuracy--diagnostic test accuracy study--echocardiography--electrocardiography--heart failure--heart left ventricle ejection fraction--human--left ventricular systolic dysfunction--machine learning--reporting bias--Review--sensitivity and specificity--systematic review--electrocardiography--heart failure--heart left ventricle function--heart stroke volume--intelligence--prospective study--retrospective study;Springer;36344908;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85141487299

A key component of modern medicine is the use of AI and ML-based computer-aided diagnosis tools to aid in making life-or-death decisions. It is common practice to use them in cardiology for the automatic early diagnosis of a variety of potentially fatal illnesses. The machine learning algorithm's need for a large amount of training data to build the learning model is an empirical challenge in the medical domain. To address this challenge, study into methods for creating synthetic patient data has blossomed. There is a higher risk of privacy invasion due to the need for massive amounts of training data for deep learning automated medical diagnostic systems that may help assess the state of the heart from this signal. To combat this issue, researchers have tried to create artificial ECG readings by analyzing only the statistical distributions of the accessible authentic training data.The primary goal of this study is to learn how generative adversarial networks can be used to create artificial ECG signals for use as training data in a classification task. In this study, we used both GAN and WGAN for generation of artificial ECG signals. © 2023 Authors.

Recently, machine learning algorithms such as deep neural networks trained on ECG signals have demonstrated the capability to identify CVDs. However, existing models for ECG anomaly detection learn from relatively long (60 s) ECG signals and tend to be heavily parameterized. Thus, they require large time and computational resources during training. To address this, we propose a novel deep learning architecture that exploits dilated convolution layers. Our architecture benefits from a classical ResNet-like formulation, and we introduce a recurrent component to better leverage temporal information in the data, while also benefiting from the dilated convolution operation. Our proposed architecture is capable of learning from single-and 12-lead ECG signals and thus offers a flexible solution for CVD diagnosis. In our experiments, we perform subject-independent ten-fold cross-validations (CVs) and compare our results with two existing benchmark models using the PhysioNet atrial fibrillation (AF) challenge dataset, the China Physiological challenge, the PTB-XL repository from PhysioNet, and the Georgia dataset. For all the four datasets, our model archives state-of-the-art performance, with an upto 8% F1 score gain achieved. Our neural conduction plots demonstrate the effectiveness of having convolution layers with varying dilation factors and the use of recurrent networks to capture rhythmic patterns. Our architecture is explainable and has the ability to learn from short ECG segments. Using neural conductance, we reveal interesting hidden patterns learned by our model, which reflect the medical phenomena/characteristics associated with CVD.

Materials and methods: The time-invariant EMR data included demographic information and comorbidities, and the time-varying EMR data were lab tests. We used a Transformer encoder module to represent the time-invariant data, and refined a long short-term memory (LSTM) with a Transformer encoder attached to the top to represent the time-varying data, taking the original measured values and their corresponding embedding vectors, masking vectors, and two types of time intervals as inputs. The proposed representations of patients with time-invariant and time-varying data were used to predict KF status (949 out of 5268 HF patients diagnosed with KF) and mortality (463 in-hospital deaths) for HF patients. Comparative experiments were conducted between the proposed model and some representative machine learning models. Ablation experiments were also performed around the time-varying data representation, including replacing the refined LSTM with the standard LSTM, GRU-D and T-LSTM, respectively, and removing the Transformer encoder and the time-varying data representation module, respectively. The visualization of the attention weights of the time-invariant and time-varying features was used to clinically interpret the predictive performance. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), and the F1-score to evaluate the predictive performance of the models. Results: The proposed model achieved superior performance, with average AUROCs, AUPRCs and F1-scores of 0.960, 0.610 and 0.759 for KF prediction and 0.937, 0.353 and 0.537 for mortality prediction, respectively. Predictive performance improved with the addition of time-varying data from longer time periods. The proposed model outperformed the comparison and ablation references in both prediction tasks. Conclusions: Both time-invariant and time-varying EMR data of patients could be efficiently represented by the proposed unified deep learning model, which shows higher performance in clinical prediction tasks. The way to use time-varying data in the current study is hopeful to be used in other kinds of time-varying data and other clinical tasks. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.;Long short-term memory--Outcome prediction--Patient representation--Time-varying data--Transformer;Comorbidity--Heart Failure--Humans--Machine Learning--Patients--Prognosis--Ablation--Brain--Cardiology--Forecasting--Learning systems--Signal encoding--Data representations--Heart failure--Learning models--Outcome prediction--Patient representation--Predictive performance--Time invariants--Time varying--Time-varying data--Transformer--aged--Article--cardiac patient--comorbidity--data classification--deep learning--demographics--electronic medical record--embedding--female--functional status--heart failure--human--in-hospital mortality--kidney failure--laboratory test--length of stay--long short term memory network--male--medical informatics--mortality--outcome assessment--prediction--predictive model--time--heart failure--machine learning--patient--prognosis--Long short-term memory;Academic Press Inc.;37339714;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85163221964

Moreover, modern advancement in noninvasive imaging of heart via ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging has enhanced the detection of secret cardiac amyloidosis in patients identified with the heart disease. This article focused on detecting the heart disease especially cardiac amyloidosis on electro cardio gram images using recent technology of both machine learning and deep learning approaches. In addition, apart from detecting the disease on images, we are categorizing the heart images as normal and cardiac amyloidosis if any deviations occur. For CA disease identification along with its classification, 300 cardiac images have taken and those images are analyzed using machine learning algorithms namely nearest centroid, gradient boosting and random forest. Several metrics such as precision, recall, f-score, sensitivity, accuracy, and confusion matrix based on binary classification which classifies the images into positive (CA) and negative (non-CA) are estimated. Among these approaches, gradient boosting method achieves 95% accuracy as better outcomes which measure the model performance in detecting cardiac amyloidosis disease as well as ECG images are categorized into either normal or abnormal via classification metrics. Furthermore, we applied deep learning based neural network “DeepNet” model is applied on augmented data along with CNN which attains 93% accuracy in CA disease identification. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.;BRISK descriptors--cardiac amyloidosis--DeepNet model--machine learning--term frequency-inverse document frequency;Adaptive boosting--Cardiology--Decision trees--Deep learning--Diseases--Electrocardiograms--Inverse problems--Learning systems--Magnetic resonance imaging--Text processing--Ultrasonic applications--BRISK descriptor--Cardiac amyloidosis--Deepnet model--Descriptors--Gradient boosting--Heart disease--Learning techniques--Machine-learning--Modern advancement--Term frequencyinverse document frequency (TF-IDF)--Heart;John Wiley and Sons Inc;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85125466227

Previous applications focused primarily on classifying known ECG patterns in well-controlled clinical settings. However, this approach does not fully capitalize on the potential of deep learning, which directly learns important features without relying on a priori knowledge. In addition, deep learning applications to ECG data obtained from wearable devices have not been well studied, especially in the field of ADHF prediction. Methods: We used ECG and transthoracic bioimpedance data from the SENTINEL-HF study, which enrolled patients (≥21 years) who were hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of heart failure or with ADHF symptoms. To build an ECG-based prediction model of ADHF, we developed a deep cross-modal feature learning pipeline, termed ECGX-Net, that utilizes raw ECG time series and transthoracic bioimpedance data from wearable devices. To extract rich features from ECG time series data, we first adopted a transfer learning approach in which ECG time series were transformed into 2D images, followed by feature extraction using ImageNet-pretrained DenseNet121/VGG19 models. After data filtering, we applied cross-modal feature learning in which a regressor was trained with ECG and transthoracic bioimpedance. Then, we concatenated the DenseNet121/VGG19 features with the regression features and used them to train a support vector machine (SVM) without bioimpedance information. Results: The high-precision classifier using ECGX-Net predicted ADHF with a precision of 94 %, a recall of 79 %, and an F1-score of 0.85. The high-recall classifier with only DenseNet121 had a precision of 80 %, a recall of 98 %, and an F1-score of 0.88. We found that ECGX-Net was effective for high-precision classification, while DenseNet121 was effective for high-recall classification. Conclusion: We show the potential for predicting ADHF from single-channel ECG recordings obtained from outpatients, enabling timely warning signs of heart failure. Our cross-modal feature learning pipeline is expected to improve ECG-based heart failure prediction by handling the unique requirements of medical scenarios and resource limitations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.;Deep learning--ECG analysis--Heart failure--Wearable device;Electrocardiography--Heart Failure--Humans--Support Vector Machine--Wearable Electronic Devices--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Deep learning--Forecasting--Heart--Learning systems--Pipelines--Support vector machines--Time series--Wearable technology--Bio-impedance--Cross-modal--Deep learning--ECG analysis--ECG data--Failures prediction--Feature learning--Heart failure--Times series--Wearable devices--acute heart failure--Article--artifact--atrial fibrillation--clinical article--ECG abnormality--electrocardiography--feature extraction--feature learning (machine learning)--follow up--hospital readmission--human--multilayer perceptron--prediction--QRS interval--radial basis function--support vector machine--symptom--transfer of learning--transthoracic echocardiography--electrocardiography--heart failure--Electrocardiograms;Elsevier B.V.;37210152;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85153532836

Several kinds of AF exist as paroxysmal AF, persistent AF, and permanent or chronic AF. Based on electrocardiograms (ECG), wavelet transform (WT), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the present study proposes an algorithm to classify between healthy subjects and patients suffering from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). The classification results will then help for prediction purposes. Methods: The MIT-BIH “PAF” database (5-min signals before and during AF) and the PTB-XL database (each record is 10 s in duration) were used. Our model was tested on three leads of PTB-XL dataset. For each signal, a finite number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) was obtained using empirical mode decomposition. In order to select the most informative IMFs, two criteria were proposed: “variance ratio” and “percentage of occurrence of IMFs”. The selected IMFs serve as inputs to the continuous wavelet transform. The latter is used to extract features that are then inputs to our CNN classification model. The dataset was divided into training, validation, and test sets in proportions of 64%, 16%, and 20%, respectively. Results: For the “PAF” database, we achieve a maximum accuracy of 98.2% for the “variance ratio” selection and 98.8% for the “percentage of occurrence of IMFs”, compared to 97.1% and 97.5% before the application of these approaches. In addition, the presented approaches reduce the number of IMFs by at least 50%. The tested accuracy reached 98.8% on the PTB-XL dataset. Conclusion: By combining the variance ratio and percentages of IMFs, the extracted features allow to classify ECG of healthy patients from that of patients suffering from AF. The accuracy obtained outperforms some recent studies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd;Artificial intelligence--Continuous wavelet transform--Convolutional neural network--Electrocardiogram--Empirical mode decomposition--Intrinsic mode functions--Variance--Wavelets;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Database systems--Diseases--Statistical tests--Wavelet decomposition--Atrial fibrillation--Continuous Wavelet Transform--Convolutional neural network--Empirical Mode Decomposition--Intrinsic Mode functions--Paroxysmal atrial fibrillations--Patient's suffering--Variance--Variance ratio--Wavelet--artificial intelligence--atrial fibrillation--back propagation neural network--clinical article--continuous wavelet transform--convolutional neural network--deep learning--discrete wavelet transform--electrocardiogram--empirical mode decomposition--human--intrinsic mode function--paroxysmal atrial fibrillation--prediction--predictive value--Review--support vector machine--Electrocardiograms--Empirical mode decomposition--Intrinsic mode functions;Elsevier Ltd;;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85144823794

Although cardiovascular structures—such as cardiac shadows and vessels—are visible on chest radiographs, the ability of these radiographs to estimate cardiac function and valvular disease is poorly understood. Using datasets from multiple institutions, we aimed to develop and validate a deep-learning model to simultaneously detect valvular disease and cardiac functions from chest radiographs. Methods: In this model development and validation study, we trained, validated, and externally tested a deep learning-based model to classify left ventricular ejection fraction, tricuspid regurgitant velocity, mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary regurgitation, and inferior vena cava dilation from chest radiographs. The chest radiographs and associated echocardiograms were collected from four institutions between April 1, 2013, and Dec 31, 2021: we used data from three sites (Osaka Metropolitan University Hospital, Osaka, Japan--Habikino Medical Center, Habikino, Japan--and Morimoto Hospital, Osaka, Japan) for training, validation, and internal testing, and data from one site (Kashiwara Municipal Hospital, Kashiwara, Japan) for external testing. We evaluated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Findings: We included 22 551 radiographs associated with 22 551 echocardiograms obtained from 16 946 patients. The external test dataset featured 3311 radiographs from 2617 patients with a mean age of 72 years [SD 15], of whom 49·8% were male and 50·2% were female. The AUCs, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for this dataset were 0·92 (95% CI 0·90–0·95), 86% (85–87), 82% (75–87), and 86% (85–88) for classifying the left ventricular ejection fraction at a 40% cutoff, 0·85 (0·83–0·87), 75% (73–76), 83% (80–87), and 73% (71–75) for classifying the tricuspid regurgitant velocity at a 2·8 m/s cutoff, 0·89 (0·86–0·92), 85% (84–86), 82% (76–87), and 85% (84–86) for classifying mitral regurgitation at the none-mild versus moderate-severe cutoff, 0·83 (0·78–0·88), 73% (71–74), 79% (69–87), and 72% (71–74) for classifying aortic stenosis, 0·83 (0·79–0·87), 68% (67–70), 88% (81–92), and 67% (66–69) for classifying aortic regurgitation, 0·86 (0·67–1·00), 90% (89–91), 83% (36–100), and 90% (89–91) for classifying mitral stenosis, 0·92 (0·89–0·94), 83% (82–85), 87% (83–91), and 83% (82–84) for classifying tricuspid regurgitation, 0·86 (0·82–0·90), 69% (68–71), 91% (84–95), and 68% (67–70) for classifying pulmonary regurgitation, and 0·85 (0·81–0·89), 86% (85–88), 73% (65–81), and 87% (86–88) for classifying inferior vena cava dilation. Interpretation: The deep learning-based model can accurately classify cardiac functions and valvular heart diseases using information from digital chest radiographs. This model can classify values typically obtained from echocardiography in a fraction of the time, with low system requirements and the potential to be continuously available in areas where echocardiography specialists are scarce or absent.

Rapid and accurate diagnosis of the early stage of VHD based on cardiac phonocardiogram (PCG) signal is critical that allows for optimum medication and reduction of mortality rate. Methods: To this end, the current study proposes novel deep learning (DL)-based high-performance VHD detection frameworks that are relatively simpler in terms of network structures, yet effective for accurately detecting multiple VHDs. We present three different frameworks considering both 1D and 2D PCG raw signals. For 1D PCG, Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and linear prediction cepstral coefficients (LPCC) features, whereas, for 2D PCG, various deep convolutional neural networks (D-CNNs) features are extracted. Additionally, nature/bio-inspired algorithms (NIA/BIA) including particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) have been utilized for automatic and efficient feature selection directly from the raw PCG signal. To further improve the performance of the classifier, vision transformer (ViT) has been implemented levering the self-attention mechanism on the time frequency representation (TFR) of 2D PCG signal. Our extensive study presents a comparative performance analysis and the scope of enhancement for the combination of different descriptors, classifiers, and feature selection algorithms.

Heart diseases is among the most severe diseases, and it impacts a lot of people all around the world. Early detection of heart illness may result in its prevention or amelioration, which may lower mortality rates. The proposed study used different heart disease datasets and deep learning techniques for classification. Deep learning (DL) can deliver a powerful answer for decision-making and correct predictions of valvular heart diseases. Early prediction of coronary heart disorder may also store many people's lives--detecting cardiovascular illnesses like coronary heart attacks, coronary artery illness, etc., is a reproving task using ordinary scientific analysis. Feature extraction and classification techniques of heart sound provide a better way of study of phonocardiography (PCG) signal analysis which eventually reduces the cost, makes the system compact, and at the same time, can work with big data. This paper mainly has two segments feature extraction and classification. In feature extraction section, time domain features, statistical features, and acoustic features are used. For the classification of heart sound, the proposed CNN-based Residual Network is used. The CNN-based network is very effective in heart sound analysis, requiring much less computation time. The proposed CNN-based model scored an accuracy of 97.04 ±0.05 % on the test dataset with a sensitivity of 96.8 ± 0.03 % and specificity of 96.2 ± 0.04%.  © 2023 IEEE.;Acoustic Stethoscope--Classification--CNN--Feature Extraction--Machine Learning--PCG Signal--Valvular Heart Sound;Behavioral research--Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Decision making--Deep learning--Diseases--Extraction--Forecasting--Heart--Learning systems--Phonocardiography--Statistical tests--Time domain analysis--Acoustic stethoscope--Cardiovascular disease--Coronary artery disease--Feature extraction and classification--Features extraction--Heart disease--Heart sounds--Machine-learning--Phonocardiography signal--Valvular heart sound--Feature extraction;IEEE Computer Society;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85189298693

Early detection and risk assessment of cardiovascular diseases are important for effective prevention and timely intervention. An analysis of deep learning methods used for prediction of CVR based on RFI. Since it is an extension of central nervous system, the retina gives an exceptional chance for safe medical diagnosis. Using multiple types of retinal fundus images together with the patient and clinical data, we developed a new deep learning model for prediction of several vital parameters for cardiovascular diseases. With CNN, it is possible to extract relevant features from retinal images without involving any manual procedures. The main aim of our study is to predict hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia, which are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Our deep learning model achieves incredible accuracy in identifying high-risk individuals by identifying changes in brain vessels, microaneurysms, and other signs of pathology. Additionally, the model provides good information about the relationship between the visibility of the eye and the severity of these problems. We also consider ways of interpreting predictive models which help us understand how retinal changes relate to CV risk based on pathophysiological mechanism. Such research can lead the doctors on how to improve themselves if possible and intervene earlier for the sake of preventing this health condition. © 2023 IEEE.;cardiovascular disease--deep learning--machine learning--retina;Cardiology--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Learning systems--Ophthalmology--Risk assessment--Cardiovascular disease--Central nervous systems--Deep learning--Heart disease--Learning methods--Learning models--Machine-learning--Retina--Retinal image--Risks assessments--Forecasting;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85187776559

Biosensing devices are used for the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease at the point-of-care (POC), with lateral flow assays (LFAs) being particularly useful. However, due to their low sensitivity, most LFAs have been shown to have difficulties detecting low analytic concentrations. Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) and image processing reduced this detection constraint and improved disease diagnosis. This paper presents a novel patches-selection approach for generating LFA images from the test line and control line of LFA images, analyzing the image features, and utilizing them to reliably predict and classify LFA images by deploying classification algorithms, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The generated images were supplied as input data to the CNN model, a strong model for extracting crucial information from images, to classify the target images and provide risk stratification levels to medical professionals. With this approach, the classification model produced about 98% accuracy, and as per the literature review, this approach has not been investigated previously. These promising results show the proposed method may be useful for identifying a wide variety of diseases and conditions, including cardiovascular problems. © 2022 The Authors;Cardiac biomarker convolutional neural networks C-Reactive proteins--Deep learning image processing lateral flow assays point-of-care;Artificial Intelligence--Biomarkers--Biosensing Techniques--Cardiovascular Diseases--Humans--Point-of-Care Systems--Biomarkers--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Convolution--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Image classification--Image enhancement--Medical imaging--Neural network models--biological marker--biological marker--C-reactive proteins--Cardiac biomarker convolutional neural network C-reactive protein--Cardiac biomarkers--Cardiovascular disease--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning image processing lateral flow assay point-of-care--Images processing--Lateral-flow assays--Patch selection--Point of care--accuracy--Article--artificial intelligence--cardiovascular disease--classification algorithm--computer model--convolutional neural network--deep learning--genetic procedures--health practitioner--human--image analysis--image processing--lateral flow immunochromatography--point of care testing--risk assessment--signal noise ratio--stratification--support vector machine--cardiovascular disease--point of care system--Convolutional neural networks;Elsevier Ltd;36586151;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85145264954

In this study, we used a CSX dataset from the coronary angiography registry of Tehran's Heart Center at Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Iran to develop several machine learning (ML) methods combined with uncertainty quantification of the obtained results. Uncertainty quantification plays a significant role in both traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) studies allowing researchers to create trustable clinical detection systems. We propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, called Binarized Multi-Gate Mixture of Bayesian Experts (MoBE), which is an effective ensemble technique for accurately classifying CSX data. The proposed binarized multi-gate model relies on a double quantified uncertainty strategy at the feature selection and decision making stages. First, we use a clinician-in-the-loop scenario with a belief-uncertainty paradigm at the feature selection stage. Second, we use Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) as experts in MoBE and Monte Carlo (MC) dropout for gates at the decision making uncertainty quantification stage.

Vessel stenosis in the coronary artery is considered to be the major risk of CVD. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is one of the widely used noninvasive imaging modalities in coronary artery diagnosis due to its superior image resolution. Clinically, segmentation of coronary arteries is essential for the diagnosis and quantification of coronary artery disease. Recently, a variety of works have been proposed to address this problem. However, on one hand, most works rely on in-house datasets, and only a few works published their datasets to the public which only contain tens of images. On the other hand, their source code have not been published, and most follow-up works have not made comparison with existing works, which makes it difficult to judge the effectiveness of the methods and hinders the further exploration of this challenging yet critical problem in the community. In this paper, we propose a large-scale dataset for coronary artery segmentation on CTA images. In addition, we have implemented a benchmark in which we have tried our best to implement several typical existing methods. Furthermore, we propose a strong baseline method which combines multi-scale patch fusion and two-stage processing to extract the details of vessels. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves better performance than existing works on the proposed large-scale dataset.

This can be attributed to the direct connection between the heart’s rhythm and the activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The cost-effectiveness and ease with which one may obtain HRV data also make it an exciting and potential clinical tool for evaluating and identifying various health impairments. This article comprehensively describes a range of signal decomposition techniques and time-series modeling methods recently used in HRV analyses apart from the conventional HRV generation and feature extraction methods. Various weight-based feature selection approaches and dimensionality reduction techniques are summarized to assess the relevance of each HRV feature vector. The popular machine learning-based HRV feature classification techniques are also described. Some notable clinical applications of HRV analyses, like the detection of diabetes, sleep apnea, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension, renal failure, psychiatric disorders, ANS Activity of Patients Undergoing Weaning from Mechanical Ventilation, and monitoring of fetal distress and neonatal critical care, are discussed. The latest research on the effect of external stimuli (like consuming alcohol) on autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity using HRV analyses is also summarized. The HRV analysis approaches summarized in our article can help future researchers to dive deep into their potential diagnostic applications. © 2023 by the authors.;artificial intelligence--cannabis--feature selection--heart rate variability--signal analysis;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Cost effectiveness--Diagnosis--Feature extraction--Heart--Time series analysis--Ventilation--Autonomic nervous system activities--Cannabis--Cardiac autonomic functions--Clinical tools--Features selection--Heart rate variability--Heart rate variability analysis--Parasympathetic nervous systems--Signals analysis--Sympathetic nervous systems--Signal analysis;Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI);;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85172387094

S-ICDs carry a risk of so-called T wave over sensing (TWOS), which can lead to inappropriate shocks that carry an inherent health risk. For this reason, according to current practice patients’ Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are manually screened by a cardiologist over 10 s to assess the T:R ratio—the ratio between the amplitudes of the T and R waves which is used as a marker for the likelihood of TWOS—with a plastic template. Unfortunately, the temporal variability of a patient’ T:R ratio can render such a screening procedure, which relies on an inevitably short ECG segment due to its manual nature, unreliable. In this paper, we propose and investigate a tool based on deep learning for the automatic prediction of the T:R ratios from multiple 10-second segments of ECG recordings capable of carrying out a 24-hour automated screening. Thanks to the significantly increased screening window, such a screening would provide far more reliable T:R ratio predictions than the currently utilized 10-second, template-based, manual screening is capable of. Our tool is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to fully automate such an otherwise manual and potentially inaccurate procedure. From a methodological perspective, we evaluate different deep learning model architectures for our tool, assess a range of stochastic-gradient-descent-based optimization methods for training their underlying deep-learning model, perform hyperparameter tuning, and create ensembles of the best performing models in order to identify which combination leads to the best performance. We find that the resulting model, which has been integrated into a prototypical tool for use by clinicians, is able to predict T:R ratios with very high accuracy. Thanks to this, our automated T:R ratio detection tool will enable clinicians to provide a completely automated assessment of whether a patient is eligible for S-ICD implantation which is more reliable than current practice thanks to adopting a significantly longer ECG screening window which better and more accurately captures the behavior of the patient’s T:R ratio than the current manual practice. © 2023, The Author(s).;Deep learning--Machine learning--Optimization--Subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillators;;Springer;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85160251694

In recent days, most of the deaths have been happening because of noncommunicable diseases. Despite the significant advancements in medical diagnosis, cardiovascular diseases are still the most prominent cause of mortality worldwide. With recent innovations in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, there has been an enormous surge in the clinical field, especially in cardiology. Several ML and DL algorithms are useful for predicting cardiovascular diseases. The predictive capability of these algorithms is promising for various cardiovascular diseases like coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, heart failure, and others. We also review the lung interactions during heart disease. After the study of various ML and DL models with different datasets, the performance of the various strategies is analyzed.

It was enhanced considerably over several years to deliver functional information for diagnosing and managing cardiovascular disease. CMRI image delivers non-invasive, clear access to the heart and great vessels. The segmentation of CMRI provides quantification parameters such as myocardial viability, ejection fraction, cardiac chamber volume, and morphological details. In general, experts interpret the CMR images by delineating the images manually. The manual segmentation process is time-consuming, and it has been observed that the final observation varied with the opinion of the different experts. Convolution neural network is a new-age technology that provides impressive results compared to manual ones. In this study convolution neural network model is used for the segmentation task. The neural network parameters have been optimized to perform on the novel data set for accurate predictions. With other parameters, epochs play an essential role in training the network, as the network should not be under-fitted or overfitted. The relationship between the hyperparameter epoch and accuracy is established in the model. The model delivers the accuracy of 0.88 in terms of the IoU coefficient.

In interventional cardiology, artificial intelligence has shown potential in providing data interpretation and automated analysis from electrocardiogram, echocardiography, computed tomography angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and electronic patient data. Clinical decision support has the potential to assist in improving patient safety and making prognostic and diagnostic conjectures in interventional cardiology procedures. Robot-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention, along with functional and quantitative assessment of coronary artery ischemia and plaque burden on intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), are the major applications of AI. Machine learning algorithms are used in these applications, and they have the potential to bring a paradigm shift in intervention. Recently, an efficient branch of machine learning has emerged as a deep learning algorithm for numerous cardiovascular applications. However, the impact deep learning on the future of cardiology practice is not clear. Predictive models based on deep learning have several limitations including low generalizability and decision processing in cardiac anatomy. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.;;Algorithms--Artificial Intelligence--Cardiology--Coronary Artery Disease--Humans--Machine Learning--Myocardial Ischemia--acute heart infarction--all cause mortality--anatomy--artificial intelligence--artificial neural network--atrial fibrillation--cardiology--cardiovascular mortality--cardiovascular procedure--catheterization--computed tomographic angiography--convolutional neural network--coronary artery disease--decision making--decision tree--deep learning--echocardiography--electrocardiogram--electronic health record--Food and Drug Administration--fractional flow reserve--health care--health insurance--heart catheterization--heart hemodynamics--heart muscle ischemia--heart muscle revascularization--human--image reconstruction--interventional cardiology--intravascular ultrasound--k means clustering--learning algorithm--machine learning--mortality--myocardial perfusion imaging--nuclear magnetic resonance imaging--percutaneous coronary intervention--principal component analysis--quality of life--random forest--Review--sample size--semi supervised machine learning--single photon emission computed tomography--supervised machine learning--support vector machine--unsupervised machine learning--algorithm--artificial intelligence--coronary artery disease--heart muscle ischemia--machine learning;Elsevier Inc.;36921654;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85152637835

It is a familiar cardiovascular diagnostic test apart from chest X-ray and echocardiography. The medical knowledge is enhanced by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches like deep learning and machine learning because of the increase in the complexity as well as the volume of the data that in turn unlocks the clinically significant information. Similarly, the usage of developing information as well as communication technologies is becoming important for generating a persistent healthcare service via which the chronic disease and elderly patients get their medical facility at their home that in turn enhances the life quality and avoids hospitalizations. The main intention of this paper is to design and develop a novel heart disease diagnosis using speckle-noise reduction and deep learning-based feature learning and classification. The datasets gathered from the hospital are composed of both the images and the video frames. Since echocardiogram images suffer from speckle noise, the initial process is the speckle-noise reduction technique. Then, the pattern extraction is performed by combining the Local Binary Pattern (LBP), and Weber Local Descriptor (WLD) referred to as the hybrid pattern extraction. The deep feature learning is conducted by the optimized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), in which the features are extracted from the max-pooling layer, and the fully connected layer is replaced by the optimized Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for handling the diagnosis of heart disease, thus proposed model is termed as CRNN. The novel Adaptive Electric Fish Optimization (A-EFO) is used for performing feature learning and classification. In the final step, the best accuracy is achieved with the introduced model, while a comparative analysis is accomplished over the traditional models. From the experimental analysis, FDR of A-EFO-CRNN at 75% learning percentage is 21.05%, 15%, 48.89%, and 71.95% progressed than CRNN, CNN, RNN, and NN, respectively. Thus, the performance of the A-EFO-CRNN is enriched than the existing heuristic-oriented and classifiers in terms of the image dataset.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.;Adaptive Electric Fish Optimization--deep learning--echocardiogram--Heart disease diagnosis--hybrid pattern extraction;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Convolutional neural networks--Echocardiography--Extraction--Fish--Heart--Learning systems--Multilayer neural networks--Optimization--Recurrent neural networks--Speckle--Adaptive electric fish optimization--Deep learning--Echocardiogram--Electric fish--Heart disease diagnosis--Hybrid pattern extraction--Hybrid patterns--Optimisations--Pattern extraction--Speckle noise reduction--Diseases;World Scientific;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85136478972

Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant potential to impact the healthcare industry, which is already on the road to change with the digital transformation of vast quantities of information. The implementation of AI has already achieved success in the domains of molecular chemistry and drug discoveries. The reduction in costs and in the time needed for experiments to predict the pharmacological activities of new molecules is a milestone in science. These successful applications of AI algorithms provide hope for a revolution in healthcare systems. A significant part of artificial intelligence is machine learning (ML), of which there are three main types—supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. In this review, the full scope of the AI workflow is presented, with explanations of the most-often-used ML algorithms and descriptions of performance metrics for both regression and classification. A brief introduction to explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is provided, with examples of technologies that have developed for XAI. We review important AI implementations in cardiology for supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning and natural language processing, emphasizing the used algorithm. Finally, we discuss the need to establish legal, ethical, and methodical requirements for the deployment of AI models in medicine. © 2023 by the authors.;artificial intelligence--cardiology--machine learning;algorithm--artificial intelligence--artificial neural network--Bayesian learning--cardiology--clinical decision support system--computer assisted diagnosis--convolutional neural network--data mining--decision tree--deep learning--feature extraction--health care--hierarchical clustering--human--image segmentation--k means clustering--k nearest neighbor--machine learning--natural language processing--pattern recognition--performance indicator--principal component analysis--random forest--recurrent neural network--reinforcement learning (machine learning)--Review--sensitivity analysis--sentiment analysis--supervised machine learning--support vector machine--unsupervised machine learning;MDPI;;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85160219616

Additionally, the bulk of applications in the actual world need a significant amount of information. Machine learning techniques are used to automatically identify the types and severity of cardiac disease due to the rapid increase of biomedical and healthcare information. However, the ML approach has a number of drawbacks, and because of the complexity of the material, it did not always produce the best results. As a result, an improved deep learning strategy offers a superior fix for this problem. In this study, a brand-new method for diagnosing heart disease—the Grey Wolf Horse Herd optimization-based Shepard Convolutional Neural Network is developed. Here, the master node and slave node-based Spark architecture is used to carry out the heart disease detection process. Preprocessing and feature fusion are carried out in the slave node, whilst heart disease detection is done in the master node. Z-score normalization and missing value imputation are used in this case for pre-processing. The feature fusion is then carried out utilizing Hellinger distance and Deep Q Network (DQN). Furthermore, the ShCNN, which was trained using the created GWHHO algorithm, is used to identify heart disease. The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) and Horse Herd Optimization (HHO) algorithms are also incorporated into the newly developed GWHHO algorithm. Additionally, employing the VA Long Beach dataset, the experimental of the developed model yields improved results in terms of testing accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.9325, 0.9472, and 0.9142. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd;Deep Q network--Grey wolf optimizer--Hellinger distance--Horse herd optimization--Shepard convolutional neural network;Cardiology--Convolution--Data Analytics--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Heart--Learning systems--Network architecture--Statistical tests--Convolutional neural network--Deep Q network--Gray wolf optimizer--Gray wolves--Heart disease--Hellinger distance--Horse herd optimization--Optimisations--Optimizers--Shepard convolutional neural network--algorithm--Article--big data--controlled study--convolutional neural network--diagnostic accuracy--diagnostic test accuracy study--grey wolf horse herd optimization--heart disease--human--prediction--Q learning--sensitivity and specificity--shepard convolutional neural network--Convolutional neural networks;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85148899168

AI is increasingly being used in clinical medical and dental healthcare analyses, with valuable applications, which include disease diagnosis, risk assessment, treatment planning, and drug discovery. This paper presents a narrative literature review of AI use in healthcare from a multi-disciplinary perspective, specifically in the cardiology, allergology, endocrinology, and dental fields. The paper highlights data from recent research and development efforts in AI for healthcare, as well as challenges and limitations associated with AI implementation, such as data privacy and security considerations, along with ethical and legal concerns. The regulation of responsible design, development, and use of AI in healthcare is still in early stages due to the rapid evolution of the field. However, it is our duty to carefully consider the ethical implications of implementing AI and to respond appropriately.

Recently, deep learning techniques, have shown promising results in various healthcare applications. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning-based model for heart disease prediction that leverages a diverse range of risk factors, medical imaging data, and patient demographics. The proposed model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extraction of features from the medical images, which are then fused with the other risk factors and fed into a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) for classification. Deep learning techniques are used to provide insights into the features contributing to the predictions, enhancing the interpretability and transparency of our model. The performance of the model is evaluated using the real-world data set of patients with and without heart disease and compare it to traditional risk assessment approaches. Our study adds to the expanding body of literature on deep learning's potential in the healthcare industry, highlighting the transformative impact of these models in improving heart disease prediction and enabling personalized interventions. Our findings show that the suggested model performs better than others in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, outperforming traditional risk assessment methods. © 2023 IEEE.;deep learning--Heart disease--machine learning--Prediction model;Cardiology--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Diseases--Heart--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Medical imaging--Multilayer neural networks--Patient treatment--Risk assessment--Cardiovascular disease--Deep learning--Health care application--Health condition--Heart disease--Learning techniques--Machine-learning--Patient health--Prediction modelling--Risk factors--Forecasting;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85187212468

However, deploying it in practice is quite challenging, due to the inherent murmurs and a limited number of supervised samples in heart sound data. To solve these problems, not only heart sound analysis based on handcrafted features, but also computer-aided heart sound analysis based on deep learning have been extensively studied in recent years. Though with elaborate design, most of these methods still use additional pre-processing to improve classification performance, which heavily relies on time-consuming experienced engineering. In this article, we propose a parameter-efficient densely connected dual attention network (DDA) for heart sound classification. It combines two advantages simultaneously of the purely end-to-end architecture and enriched contextual representations of the self-attention mechanism. Specifically, the densely connected structure can automatically extract the information flow of heart sound features hierarchically. Alongside, improving contextual modeling capabilities, the dual attention mechanism adaptively aggregates local features with global dependencies via a self-attention mechanism, which captures the semantic interdependencies across position and channel axes respectively.

The earlier they can be predicted and classified--the more lives can be saved. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a common, inexpensive, and noninvasive tool for measuring the electrical activity of the heart and is used to detect cardiovascular disease. In this article, the power of deep learning techniques was used to predict the four major cardiac abnormalities: abnormal heartbeat, myocardial infarction, history of myocardial infarction, and normal person classes using the public ECG images dataset of cardiac patients. First, the transfer learning approach was investigated using the low-scale pretrained deep neural networks SqueezeNet and AlexNet. Second, a new convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was proposed for cardiac abnormality prediction. Third, the aforementioned pretrained models and our proposed CNN model were used as feature extraction tools for traditional machine learning algorithms, namely support vector machine, K-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, and Naïve Bayes. According to the experimental results, the performance metrics of the proposed CNN model outperform the exiting works--it achieves 98.23% accuracy, 98.22% recall, 98.31% precision, and 98.21% F1 score. Moreover, when the proposed CNN model is used for feature extraction, it achieves the best score of 99.79% using the NB algorithm. © 2020 IEEE.;Cardiovascular--deep learning--electrocar diogram (ECG) images--feature extraction--machine learning--transfer learning;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Convolution--Decision trees--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Extraction--Heart--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Nearest neighbor search--Support vector machines--Cardiovascular--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Electro-cardiogram image--Features extraction--Machine-learning--Transfer learning--Feature extraction;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85151594103

According to a survey conducted by the WHO every year, CVDs cause 17.9 million deaths worldwide. Lack of pre-prediction of CVDs is a significant factor contributing to the death of patients. Predicting CVDs is a challenging task for medical practitioners as it requires a high level of medical analysis skills and extensive knowledge. OBJECTIVES: We believe that the improvement in the accuracy of prediction can significantly reduce the risk caused by CVDs and help medical practitioners better diagnose patients. METHODS: In this study, We created a CVD prediction model. using a ML approach. We utilized various algorithms, including logistic regression, Gaussian Naive Baye, Bernoulli Naive Baye, SVM, KNN, optimized KNN, X Gradient Boosting, and random forest algorithms to analyze and predict CVDs. RESULTS: Our developed prediction model achieved an accuracy of 96.7%, indicating its effectiveness in predicting CVDs. DL algorithms can also assist in identifying, classifying, and quantifying patterns of medical images, improving patient evaluation and diagnosis based on prior medical history and evaluation patterns. CONCLUSION: Furthermore, deep learning algorithms can help in developing new drugs with minimum cost by reducing the number of clinical research trials, using prior prediction of the drug's efficacy. © 2023 M.

Previous deep learning approaches leverage semantic segmentation models to perform LV or myocardium segmentation and extract important LV parameters from the binary segmentation masks. Although these algorithms yield promising segmentation results, their per-pixel classification characteristic and complex postprocessing process of the binary masks compromise their robustness and speed. Methods: In this paper, inspired by the DeepSnake algorithm in the computer vision community, we develop a deep learning model called LVSnake for left ventricle localization. Our model generates the initial contour by connecting three key landmarks of the left ventricle output by our model including the start point, the apex point, and the end point of the endocardium. Then, a contour adjustment module is designed to refine the initial contour coordinates so as to obtain the final position of the endocardium. The extracted endocardium coordinates are used to perform Myocardial Infarction (MI) detection. Results: Experiment results on the HMC-QU dataset indicate that our model performs more favorably against previous approaches in terms of localization accuracy and robustness. The overall Endpoint-Error (EPE) of our model reaches 3.4 pixels. Using ventricular endocardium location extracted by our method to perform MI detection, the classification accuracy reaches 83.1% which exceeds that of existing studies (79.2%). Conclusions: Our proposed LVSnake can robustly and accurately extract LV positions from echocardiography, which can be used for MI detection. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd;Echocardiography--Left ventricle--LVSnake--Myocardial infarction;Cardiology--Deep learning--Heart--Pixels--Semantic Segmentation--Semantics--Cardiovascular disease--Contour localization--Initial contour--Learning approach--Left ventricles--Lvsnake--Myocardial Infarction--Objective localization--Segmentation models--Semantic segmentation--anatomic landmark--Article--computer vision--controlled study--deep learning--diagnostic accuracy--diagnostic error--diagnostic test accuracy study--disease classification--echocardiography--endocardium--feature extraction--heart cycle--heart infarction--heart left ventricle--human--image processing--imaging algorithm--intermethod comparison--k fold cross validation--major clinical study--model--quantitative diagnosis--random forest--segmentation algorithm--support vector machine--videorecording--Echocardiography;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85161270055

However, it is still a challenge to detect arrhythmia based on ECG basic characteristics because of the non-stationary nature of ECG signal even cardiologists faced challenges in arrhythmia diagnosis. Therefore, automatic arrhythmia detection-based ECG signals with height accuracy is a serious and indispensable task. Hence In this paper, we propose a new deep learning-based approach called “DeepArr” that uses a sequential fusion method to combine feed-forward and recurrent deep neural networks to exploit relevant features representation of arrhythmia from electrocardiograms (ECG) signals. A comprehensive experimental study has been made in this research, which shows that the proposed approach offers the most efficient tool for accurate classification and ranks top of the list of recently published algorithms on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset. 10-fold cross-validation is carried out. The proposed DeepArr model achieved an accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, and F1-score of 99.46%, 99.57%, 97.01%, 98.26%, and 97.63%, respectively.

As a result of the vast amount of psychiatric data included within the healthcare industry, machine learning models were utilized in order to efficiently deliver conclusions regarding heart disease prediction. The adoption of methods derived from machine learning enables the reliable classification of individuals according to whether or not they are healthy. The framework used in this study can understand the basics of effectively evaluating a patient’s risk profile from features of clinical data. The aforementioned model was developed by utilizing both machine learning and deep learning in tandem with one another. Heart disease is widely acknowledged as one of the primary contributors to death rates across the globe. Large amounts of clinical data are stored in the many biomedical instruments and computer systems that are found in hospitals. Therefore, having a solid understanding of the data around heart disease is quite crucial if one wishes to increase the accuracy of their predictions. There have been a lot of experimental evaluations of the performance of models that have been developed using classification algorithms and relevant features that have been selected using a variety of different approaches to feature selection. The exploratory investigation used a dataset on heart illness to test four different classification strategies. These strategies were random forest, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and convolutional neural network.

One analysis is performed for each of the following conditions: diabetes, cancer, skin disease, and heart disease. A single analysis cannot forecast more than one disease using a same system. Numerous machine learning approaches can perform predictive analytics on colossal data sets. Although using predictive modeling in healthcare is challenging, it will eventually help practitioners make quick choices about the health and treatment of patients based on vast amounts of data. In this post, a system that uses the Flask API to forecast numerous diseases is proposed. Tensor flow, Flask API, and machine learning techniques were used to implement multiple illness analyses. The model behavior is saved using Python pickling, and the pickle file is loaded when needed using Python unpickling. The goal in this effort is to create a web application that can forecast numerous diseases, such as breast cancer, diabetes, heart disease, malaria, and pneumonia, using the principles of machine learning and deep learning. The finished model's behavior will be captured in a Python pickle file. The Flask API is created. The parameters of the disease must be sent together with the disease name when using this API. The relevant model will be called by the Flask API, which then returns the patient's state. In order to track patient condition and provide early warnings to patients in order to reduce death rates, it is important to identify the most common diseases. © 2023 IEEE.;Flask API (Application Programming Interface)--Machine Learning algorithms--Python pickling;Application programming interfaces (API)--Bottles--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--High level languages--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Predictive analytics--Applications programming interfaces--Condition--Flask  application programming interface--Heart disease--Learning projects--Machine learning algorithms--Machine-learning--Modeling behaviour--One-time--Python pickling--Python;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85163805656

Recently, Deep Learning (DL) has shown great potential for the development of intelligent mobile Health (mHealth) interventions for chronic diseases that could revolutionize the delivery of health care anytime, anywhere. The aim of this study is to present a systematic review of studies that have used DL based on mHealth data for the diagnosis, prognosis, management, and treatment of major chronic diseases and advance our understanding of the progress made in this rapidly developing field. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DMs) is a regular chronic disorder that is caused by the secretion of insulin, which leads to serious death-related issues and the most complicated ones. Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is the most frequent issue related to T2DM patients. The major concern is recognizing the high possibility of CHD complications, yet the model is not available to identify it. This work introduces a deep learning technique that can predict heart disease effectively using a hybrid model, which integrates DNNs (Deep Neural Networks) with a Multi-Head Attention Model called MADNN. The scheme can be designed to automatically learn the best-quality features from Electronic Health Records (EHRs), and effectively combine heterogeneous and time-sequenced medical data for predicting the risk of CVD. The analysis is done using the Kaggle dataset. The outcomes prove that the MADNN has improved accuracy by about 95% and indicates the precise accuracy is higher for the disease compared with SVM, CNN and ANN. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

AF detection continues to be a significant challenge, particularly in the long term, to improve the quality of life of people suffering from the disease and reduce treatment costs. In recent decades, machine learning and deep learning have provided promising results in classifying heart conditions with moderate interpretability. We hypothesized that the complexity of AF could be handled in low-dimensional latent spaces in terms of non-Gaussian manifolds and that feature selection techniques on an audio-inspired feature set could improve the detection and interpretability of the AF phenomenon. Therefore, we used long-term monitoring databases in which noise-reduction filters preprocessed the signals and extracted their RR-value sequences. From these datasets, several audio spectral characteristics were calculated and used as input vectors for different types of manifold estimators. We also used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, a feature selection technique. Our experiments showed that these spectral representations of AF segments can yield better-defined low-dimensional embedding manifolds and acceptable intrinsic separability of AF from sinus rhythm. Moreover, including supervised stages and LASSO regression improved the overall performance of this proposal. The performance obtained in classifying AF signals versus normal ones reaches a precision of 91.2%, a recall of 95.5%, and an accuracy of 94.5%. These results pave the way for manifold learning and low-dimensional latent spaces in AF applications, and they support the advantage of using machine learning methods in different AF problems. © 2013 IEEE.;Atrial fibrillation--feature selection--LASSO regression--latent space separability--manifold learning;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Deep learning--Electrocardiography--Feature Selection--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Regression analysis--Atrial fibrillation--Deep learning--Features extraction--Features selection--Latent space separability--Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression--Least absolute shrinkage and selection operators--Machine learning algorithms--Manifold--Manifold learning--Rhythm--Diseases;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85173037717

Neurological damage is the primary cause of most deaths following a stroke, with cardiovascular issues being the second leading cause. Research findings, both from clinical and experimental studies, indicate a cause-and-effect connection between damage to the brain and the development of heart disease. If left untreated at early stages, stroke, and heart disease can lead to death. Therefore, Early diagnosis and monitoring of these diseases are crucial for the reduction of morbidity and mortality. In this research electronic medical records of patients’ symptoms, body features, clinical laboratory test values, and brain images were used to analyze patterns, and train and validate different machine learning and deep learning models to predict heart disease and brain stroke. Three types of modules including machine learning-based heart disease, brain stroke prediction using clinical data, and a deep learning-based brain stroke prediction using brain MRI image data were designed and deployed into a user-friendly custom-made user interface. The heart disease and brain stroke prediction models were found to be 100% and 97.1% accurate in predicting heart disease and brain stroke, respectively, based on clinical and patient information, while the MRI image-based deep learning stroke prediction model was 96.67% accurate. Our experimental results suggest that the proposed systems may have the potential to impact clinical practice and become a decision support system for physicians to predict heart disease and brain stroke from a set of risk factors and laboratory tests improving diagnosis accuracy for better treatment planning. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Brain stroke--Clinical data--Deep learning--Heart disease--Machine learning--Prediction;Brain mapping--Cardiology--Clinical research--Decision support systems--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Heart--Hospital data processing--Learning systems--Magnetic resonance imaging--Medical computing--User interfaces--Brain strokes--Clinical data--Deep learning--Heart disease--Laboratory test--Machine-learning--MRI Image--Multi-modal--Patient data--Prediction modelling--Forecasting;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85173570616

Prevention of heart disease is one of the vital areas in medical research. The objective of this study is to design a diagnostic prediction system that can detect and predict heart disease at an early stage by mining relevant data from the clinical dataset using datamining, statistics, and deep learning techniques. Data preprocessing is performed in multiphase such as removing of missing data, numeric transformation, and data normalization for mining an efficient data. Our main contribution is to design an efficient deep neural network model for the early prevention of heart disease. In this point of view, we have designed heart disease prediction system consists of two deep learning neural network architectures namely, (i) Deep neural network in Recognition of heart disease (DeepR) and (ii) efficient Deep neural network in Recognition of heart disease (eDeepR). In these two proposed architectures, DeepR generates 97.64% accuracy and eDeepR generates 99.53% accuracy for recognition of heart disease, after recognition which can be applicable for prevention.

The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that 17.9 million individuals die yearly due to complications from heart disease and other heart-related ailments. ECG monitoring and early detection are critical to decreasing myocardial infarction (MI) mortality. Thus, a non-invasive method to accurately classify different types of MI would be extremely beneficial. Our proposed study aims to detect and classify Anterior and Inferior MI infarction with advanced deep and machine learning techniques. A newly created UWB radar signal-based image dataset is used to conduct our study experiments. A novel Convolutional spatial Feature Engineering (CSFE) technique is proposed to extract the spatial features from the image dataset. The spatial features consist of both spatial and temporal information which allows machine learning models to leverage both the spatial and temporal relationships present in the data. Study results show that using the proposed CSFE technique, the advanced machine learning techniques achieved high-performance accuracy scores. The K-Neighbors Classifier (KNC) outperformed with a high-performance accuracy score of 98% for detecting Anterior and Inferior patients. The applied methods are fully hyperparametric tuned, and performance is validated using the k-fold cross-validation method.  © 2013 IEEE.;anterior and inferior--Cardiovascular disease--machine learning--MI infarction--transfer learning--UWB radar;Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Feature extraction--Learning algorithms--Nearest neighbor search--Noninvasive medical procedures--Ultra-wideband (UWB)--Anterior and inferior--Artery--Cardiovascular disease--Features extraction--Machine-learning--Myocardial Infarction--Myocardial infarction infarction--Myocardium--Sensitivity--Solid modelling--Transfer learning--Ultra wideband radars--UWB radars--Electrocardiography;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85171538422

It is divided into extraction of features and classifying patterns of ECGs. New developments in artificial intelligence show that a deep neural network trained on a large quantity of data could do feature extraction directly from the information and classify different kinds of heart arrhythmias. The purpose of this study is to extract features using transfer learning models from data. The process of transfer learning is using a model which is been trained on a dataset to predict data from a new dataset. Using two pre-trained models, Visual Geometry Group (VGG-16) with a 16-layer deep model architecture and MobileNet with a different kind of convolutional layer architecture known as Depth-wise Separable Convolution, which is much less complex and faster. In this proposed methodology, the ECG signal in time domain is converted into spectrograms signals, using the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT). The signals belonging to different kinds of heat beats were given as input to two pre-trained deep CNNs- (MobileNet, VGG16) models.

Machine learning has been shown to be a promising tool for heart disease prediction, but existing methods have limitations such as low accuracy and high computational complexity. In this research, we investigate a novel method for heart disease estimate using various machine learning. Our method is based on a combination of deep learning and ensemble learning techniques. We first use a deep learning model to extract features from the patient data. These features are then used to train an ensemble learning model, which makes the final prediction. We evaluated our method on a publicly available dataset of heart disease patients. Our method achieved an accuracy of 94%, significantly higher than the existing methods' accuracy.

Two classifiers were developed to detect cardiac conduction disorders and myocardial infarctions from 12-lead ECGs. These classifiers were trained on three open datasets after ECG preprocessing to remove noise and select relevant features. The first classifier (10 classes) identifies conditions of the ventricular conduction system: normal ECG, LBBB, ILBBB, premature ventricular complex, LAFB, LPFB, IRBBB, RBBB, nonspecific intraventricular conduction disturbance, and ventricular preexcitation. The second classifier (5 classes) distinguishes between non-infarcted ECGs and various types of myocardial infarction locations. For each QRS complex, we calculated statistical, time-domain, frequency features, and scalograms. Then we trained classifiers combining XGBoost for statistical features, an autoencoder+neural network for deep-learning features, and ResNet for scalograms. An ensemble approach was employed to get the final class prediction. We show that the developed ensemble model achieve the mean F1-score of 0.70 and 0.76 for the first and second classifier respectively. The study's key strength lies in its diverse feature extraction methods, enhancing the predictive power of machine learning models. © 2023 CinC.;;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Complex networks--Deep learning--Feature extraction--Learning systems--Time domain analysis--Cardiac conductions--Cardiovascular disease--Condition--ECG analysis--ECG preprocessing--Machine learning models--Multi-label classifications--Myocardial Infarction--Relevant features--REmove noise--Electrocardiograms;IEEE Computer Society;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85182328025

Their inherent silent nature makes them often challenging to detect very early. The management of these diseases also requires many resources. Meanwhile, Artificial Intelligence (AI) in cardiology has recently showed its ability to fill the gap. Indeed, several scoring methods and prediction models have been developed to understand the different aspects of these pathologies. The purpose of this paper is to review the state-of-the-art of the use of AI and digital technologies in cardiology in developing countries and to see the place of Africa. We have conducted a bibliometric analysis with 222 papers and an in-depth study on 26 papers using real and local databases. The words arrhythmia, cardiovascular disease, deep learning, and machine learning come up most often. Support vector machine algorithms, decision tree-based assemblers, and convolutional neural networks are more used. Among the 26 papers studied, only one comes from Africa, 24 from Asia, and one is a joint work between researches from Uganda and Brazil. The results show that countries using these AI-based methods often have accessible health databases, and collaborations between health specialists and universities are frequent. The finding of the African studies is that they focused, in most instances, on medical research to find risk factors or statistics on the epidemiology of heart disease. © 2023, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.;Africa--Algorithm--Artificial Intelligence--Cardio-vascular disease--Cardiology--Machine Learning;Convolutional neural networks--Decision trees--Deep learning--Developing countries--Diseases--Learning systems--Support vector machines--Africa--Artificial intelligence technologies--Cardiovascular disease--Causes of death--Digital technologies--Machine-learning--Method model--Prediction modelling--Scoring methods--State of the art--Cardiology;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85169664792

Image-based biomarkers commonly used in the clinic, such as ejection fraction, fail to capture more complex patterns in the heart’s 3D anatomy and thus limit diagnostic accuracy. In this work, we present the multi-objective point cloud autoencoder as a novel geometric deep learning approach for explainable infarction prediction, based on multi-class 3D point cloud representations of cardiac anatomy and function. Its architecture consists of multiple task-specific branches connected by a low-dimensional latent space to allow for effective multi-objective learning of both reconstruction and MI prediction, while capturing pathology-specific 3D shape information in an interpretable latent space. Furthermore, its hierarchical branch design with point cloud-based deep learning operations enables efficient multi-scale feature learning directly on high-resolution anatomy point clouds. In our experiments on a large UK Biobank dataset, the multi-objective point cloud autoencoder is able to accurately reconstruct multi-temporal 3D shapes with Chamfer distances between predicted and input anatomies below the underlying images’ pixel resolution. Our method outperforms multiple machine learning and deep learning benchmarks for the task of incident MI prediction by 19% in terms of Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.

However, even though it is also one of the most protected organs in a human body, it is not exactly free from threats like diseases, malfunctions, etc. as it can still be damaged by various factors. As such, this research was made to detect the existence of heart diseases that might affect the functionality of the organ itself, by using various features to be used in an experiment where it involves multiple models with hyperparameter tuning with hyperparameters that we consider to be the best for each model used from our experiment in addition with experiment using LSTM and KNN in order to determine whether or not a patient has a cardiac condition.

However, the large-scale data from various ECG databases presents a challenge to traditional artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. To address this issue, we use multi-stage classification as a promising method in sHealth. In this study, we aim to evaluate the performance and power consumption of various machine learning and deep learning algorithms in single-stage and multi-stage classification. Specifically, we analyzed beats combined from three different ECG databases and trained decision tree (DT), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), bagged tree, recurrent neural network (RNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms using time series feature extraction library (TSFEL). By dividing the data into training and testing sets, we were able to obtain the best accuracy for each algorithm and evaluate their memory usage, CPU usage, and running time. Our study highlights the advantages of multi-stage classification with DT and ANN in accurately detecting cardiovascular diseases while also consuming less power, making it a scalable and upgradable approach. The algorithm developed through this research can be implemented in wearable devices as a pre-trained model to efficiently monitor heart health and detect potential cardiac issues. The use of such IoT devices for remote heart monitoring can significantly improve access to healthcare for patients in remote or underserved areas, allowing for early detection and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.  © 2023 IEEE.;Cardiac episodes--Machine learning--Multi-stage classification--Single-stage classification--Unsupervised monitoring;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Convolutional neural networks--Diseases--Electrocardiograms--Heart--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Long short-term memory--Nearest neighbor search--Patient treatment--Support vector machines--Cardiac episode--Cardiovascular disease--Electrocardiogram signal--Heart monitoring--Machine-learning--Multi-stage classification--Multi-stages--Single stage--Single-stage classification--Unsupervised monitoring--Decision trees;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85166619029

These signals reflect the electrical activity of the heart to help cardiologists diagnose cardiac disorders. However, due to the limited amplitude and duration of the ECG signals, visual interpretation is challenging. Therefore, machine learning models have become valuable for automatically detecting MI using ECG data. In this paper, we aim to develop an automatic technique for classifying MI using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks. The data is first processed to extract heartbeats segments, which are then used to train the CNN and GRU models to recognize MI patterns. Our trained models are applied to the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) diagnostic ECG database, achieving an average accuracy of 75% and a sensitivity of 80% for MI diagnosis.

Early detection of heart failure is critical to prevent it and improve patients' survival rates. However, traditional manual methods are subject to inter examiner variability and bias, making them unreliable in diagnosing cardiac diseases. The study conducted aimed to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms in accurately identifying and classifying individuals with heart disease and those who are healthy. For this purpose, a heart disease dataset was utilized to assess the predictive capabilities of the machine learning models.

Early CVD detection is essential for successful treatment and complication prevention. Convolutional neural network (CNN), Recurrent neural networks (RNN), bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BiRNN), deep neural networks (DNN), and an ensemble model has all been used in this study's deep learning-based approach for CVD prediction. With a test size of 20%, suggested models were trained and assessed on a dataset of 303 patients. The models were assessed using a variety of criteria, including recall, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, accuracy, and precision. The ensemble model achieved best performance, with 99% accuracy, 100% precision, 100% recall, 0.97 F1-score, 1.0 sensitivity, and 0.99 specificity. The training and validation loss vs. epoch graph for each model was also analysed to assess the model's performance. Findings from this research suggest that the proposed machine learning-based approach can effectively predict CVD, with the ensemble model outperforming individual models. The use of such models can aid in the early detection and prevention of CVD, improving patient outcomes. Future work can focus on evaluating the proposed models on a larger dataset and incorporating additional clinical variables.  © 2023 IEEE.;Bidirectional recurrent neural network--Cardiovascular disease--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Ensemble model;Cardiology--Convolution--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Forecasting--Learning systems--Recurrent neural networks--Risk assessment--Statistical tests--Accurate prediction--Bidirectional recurrent neural networks--Cardiovascular disease--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Disease risks--Ensemble models--F1 scores--Learning models--Learning-based approach--Convolutional neural networks;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85170821653

The input layer, hidden layers, and output layer of the network are thus manifested. The network attempts to learn from the data that is fed to it and then makes predictions accordingly. ANN is one of the most basic types of neural network. The Artificial Neural Network does not have any specific structure--it comprises multiple neural layers for prediction. The effective application of deep learning happens in the fields like finances, marketing, and retail which has inspired the other sectors. It can be effectively applied to healthcare and medical science, such as cardiology. Doctors have a considerable amount of data in hospitals and clinics--unfortunately, there is insufficient knowledge to use the data to make a persuasive heart disease prediction decision. This paper aims to bring an effective study of machine learning in Heart Disease Prediction for scalable datasets. The study also concludes that the significant factors affecting heart disease are classified into four factors: socio-demographic characteristics, family history, medical history, environmental risk factors, and dietary/lifestyle factors. It also sub-classifies them as adjustable and non-adjustable with a detailed list. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Arvind Dagur, Karan Singh, Pawan Singh Mehra & Dhirendra Kumar Shukla--individual chapters, the contributors.;;;CRC Press;;Book chapter;Scopus;2-s2.0-85180064713

However, automated identification of cardiovascular disease using ECGs is a challenging problem and state-of-the-art performance has been attained by complex deep learning architectures. This study proposes a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) model for heart disease prediction to reduce computational complexity. ECG dataset containing averaged signals with window size 10 is used as an input. Several competing deep learning and machine learning models are used for comparison. K-fold cross-validation is used to validate the results. Experimental outcomes reveal that the MLP-based architecture can produce better outcomes than existing approaches with a 94.40% accuracy score. The findings of this study show that the proposed system achieves high performance indicating that it has the potential for deployment in a real-world, practical medical environment. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

This also calls for better risk-stratification for patients undergoing cancer treatment. Machine learning (ML), a popular branch discipline of artificial intelligence that tackles complex big data problems by identifying interaction patterns among variables, has seen increasing usage in cardio-oncology studies for risk stratification. The objective of this comprehensive review is to outline the application of ML approaches in cardio-oncology, including deep learning, artificial neural networks, random forest and summarize the cardiotoxicity identified by ML. The current literature shows that ML has been applied for the prediction, diagnosis and treatment of cardiotoxicity in cancer patients. In addition, role of ML in gender and racial disparities for cardiac outcomes and potential future directions of cardio-oncology are discussed. It is essential to establish dedicated multidisciplinary teams in the hospital and educate medical professionals to become familiar and proficient in ML in the future.

It includes conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and valvular heart disease. These conditions can lead to serious complications and even be life-threatening if not detected and managed in time. Researchers have utilized Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) to identify heart abnormalities swiftly and consistently. Various approaches have been applied to predict and treat heart disease utilizing ML and DL. This paper proposes a Machine and Deep Learning-based Stacked Model (MDLSM) to predict heart disease accurately. ML approaches such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), along with two DL models: Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Fine Tuned Deep Neural Network (FT-DNN) are used to detect heart disease. These models rely on electronic medical data that increases the likelihood of correctly identifying and diagnosing heart disease. Well-known evaluation measures (i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve) are employed to check the efficacy of the proposed approach. Results reveal that the MDLSM achieves 94.14% prediction accuracy, which is 8.30% better than the results from the baseline experiments recommending our proposed approach for identifying and diagnosing heart disease. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

Physicians could treat after identifying the heart diseases. After getting related information about the human body, immediate prediction of heart stock is awakened by the physicians for appropriate treatment and reduce the chances of a heart attack. Again, if the probability of death due to a heart attack is detected, then the treatment may help to recover the patients. To detect heart diseases, machine learning and deep learning approaches can be coded. In this study, two datasets are experimented with conventional machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms. One dataset is related to the prediction of chances of heart attack and another dataset is related to the prediction of death due to heart stock. Among all approaches, the one-dimensional convolutional neural network has been shown 99.9% accuracy of prediction. More experiments on heart diseases using different machine learning approaches can conclude the appropriate model for detecting heart diseases, whereas, in this study, the one-dimensional convolutional neural network has given the best performance.  © 2023 IEEE.;1DCNN--conventional ML--heart attack--the influence of heart attack;Cardiology--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Diseases--Heart--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Patient treatment--1DCNN--Conventional ML--Convolutional neural network--Heart attack--Heart disease--Human bodies--Human lives--One-dimensional--The influence of heart attack--Forecasting;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85177578298

While conventional short-time Fourier transform-based audio representations contain both amplitude and phase information, the vast majority of proposed machine audition methods only consider the magnitude, discarding the phase information. In this work, we explore, for the first time, the potential of complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) for heart sound classification, leveraging all available input information to derive complex representations from sound segments. We showcase the effectiveness of complex-valued neural networks for sound analysis by directly comparing them with real-valued counterparts of our employed neural architectures.

Ensemble model using the non-complex and complex varieties of the two network architectures exhibits a further 6% improvement in sensitivity of murmur and 15% increase in sensitivity of unknown. This highlights the benefits of leveraging the complex domain in deep learning for heart sound analysis. © 2023 CinC.;;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Complex networks--Deep learning--Heart--Neural networks--Patient treatment--Statistical tests--Audio representation--Complex-valued--Complex-valued neural networks--Healthcare services--Heart Murmur--Machine-learning--Phase information--PhysioNet--Scalable solution--Short time Fourier transforms--Network architecture;IEEE Computer Society;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85182319252

The precise categorization of arrhythmias is crucial for diagnosis, therapy planning, and patient care. Arrhythmias are irregular cardiac rhythms that can have catastrophic effects on a patient's health. Research on the categorization of arrhythmias frequently focuses on creating algorithms and models for precisely recognising and categorising various arrhythmia types using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. This can aid in the identification of arrhythmias and assist physicians in deciding on the best course of therapy for patients. Research on the classification of arrhythmias frequently entails the creation and assessment of several feature extraction and selection strategies in order to pinpoint pertinent aspects from ECG signals that are most instructive for precise categorization. In order to create useful arrhythmia classification models, feature engineering is a crucial step. Research in this field aids in the discovery of novel features or feature combinations that might boost classification accuracy. The objective of this venture is to make an ECG classification based on exchange learning that can perceive arrhythmia. Our DenseNet121 model was shown to have good classification abilities for identifying arrhythmia, with an accuracy rate of more than 80%. © 2023 IEEE.;Arrhythmia--Classification--CNN--Confusion matrix--Deep Learning--DenseNet121 Model--Model Training;Biomedical engineering--Biomedical signal processing--Classification (of information)--Deep learning--Diseases--Feature extraction--Learning systems--Patient treatment--Arrhythmia--Arrhythmia classification--Confusion matrix--Deep learning--Densenet121 model--Diagnosis therapy--Electrocardiogram signal--Image datasets--Machine learning approaches--Model training--Electrocardiograms;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85179838838

With a large volume of available healthcare datasets and progressions in deep learning techniques, systems are now well-equipped to predict the future trend of any health problems. From the literature survey, we found that the SVM was used to predict the heart failure rate without relating objective factors. Utilizing the intensity of important historical information in electronic health records (EHR), we have built a smart and predictive model utilizing long short-term memory (LSTM) and incorporating correlation between clinical variables. Hence, the fundamental commitment of this work is to predict the failure of the heart using an LSTM based on the patient's electronic medicinal information. We have analyzed a dataset containing the medical records of 299 heart failure patients collected at the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad (Punjab, Pakistan).

This study proposes deep learning model based on improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) architecture for classifying heart disease using ECG data. First, we collect ECG recordings from patients with and without heart disease. Then, the relevant features are extracted from the ECG data, which is a critical step as the features’ quality directly impacts the predictive models’ performance. Next, we apply the predictive models, encompassing 1D-CNN, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression, combined with fine-tuned hyperparameters and StandardScaler, to improve heart disease prediction performance.

Prenatal intervention can reduce the risk of postnatal serious CHD patients, but current diagnosis is based on qualitative criteria, which can lead to variability in diagnosis between clinicians. Objectives: To detect morphological and temporal changes in cardiac ultrasound (US) videos of fetuses with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) using deep learning models. A small cohort of 9 healthy and 13 HLHS patients were enrolled, and ultrasound videos at three gestational time points were collected. The videos were preprocessed and segmented to cardiac cycle videos, and five different deep learning CNN-LSTM models were trained (MobileNetv2, ResNet18, ResNet50, DenseNet121, and GoogleNet). The top-performing three models were used to develop a novel stacking CNN-LSTM model, which was trained using five-fold cross-validation to classify HLHS and healthy patients. The stacking CNN-LSTM model outperformed other pre-trained CNN-LSTM models with the accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1 score, and specificity of 90.5%, 92.5%, 92.5%, 92.5%, and 85%, respectively for video-wise classification, and with the accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1 score, and specificity of 90.5%, 92.5%, 92.5%, 92.5%, and 85%, respectively for subject-wise classification using ultrasound videos. This study demonstrates the potential of using deep learning models to classify CHD prenatal patients using ultrasound videos, which can aid in the objective assessment of the disease in a clinical setting.  © 2013 IEEE.;CNN-LSTM--Congenital heart defects (CHDs)--deep learning--fetal echocardiogram--hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS)--stacking machine learning;Cardiology--Diseases--Heart--Long short-term memory--Patient treatment--Cardiovascular disease--CNN-LSTM--Congenital heart defect--Congenital heart defects--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Fetal echocardiogram--Foetal heart rates--Hypoplastic leave heart syndrome--Hypoplastic left heart syndrome--Machine-learning--Stacking machine learning--Stackings--Video--Echocardiography;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85173057780

These conditions can only be diagnosed by qualified professionals using a stethoscope. Given that the patient-to-doctor ratio is low in developing countries, there is a requirement for an automated system that can classify heart sounds and analyses the phonocardiogram (PCG) recording in real-time. A critical step in the diagnosis of cardiovascular disorders (CVDs) is the computerized classification of cardiac sounds. Particularly when applied to heart sound spectrograms, Deep learning techniques have been quite successful in automating the detection of CVDs. Such a system might be created using a variety of available techniques, transfer learning is one of such utilities. A modern machine learning technique that has gained popularity due to its quick training time and improved accuracy. The lack of sufficient data, effective models and ineffective training pose certain limitations. This paper aims at developing a lightweight, fast and reliable alternative for heart sound classification. The data is cleaned, processed, and transformed into an image using spectrogram signal representation. Based on the obtained experimental outcomes of this research paper, a transfer learning pipeline could make heart sound classification and CVD detection easier while requiring less training time and resources. © 2023 IEEE.;Artificial Intelligence--Heart Sound Classification--Mel Spectrograms--Spectrogram Classification--Transfer Learning;Artificial heart--Automation--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Computer aided diagnosis--Deep learning--Heart--Learning systems--Phonocardiography--Automated classification--Heart sound classification--Heart sounds--Mel spectrogram--Sound classification--Spectrogram classification--Spectrograms--Training time--Transfer learning--Developing countries;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85163394755

However, its integration into clinical practice is still limited because the acquired ECG recording is often strongly contaminated by transient noise, thus leading to numerous false alarms of AF and requiring manual interpretation of extensive amounts of ECG data. To improve this situation, automated selection of ECG segments with sufficient quality for precise diagnosis has been widely proposed, and numerous algorithms for such ECG quality assessment can be found. Although most have reported successful performance on ECG signals acquired from healthy subjects, only a recent algorithm based on a well-known pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), such as AlexNet, has maintained a similar efficiency in the context of paroxysmal AF. Hence, having in mind the latest major advances in the development of neural networks, the main goal of this work was to compare the most recent pre-trained CNN models in terms of classification performance between high- and low-quality ECG excerpts and computational time. In global values, all reported a similar classification performance, which was significantly superior than the one provided by previous methods based on combining hand-crafted ECG features with conventional machine learning classifiers. Nonetheless, shallow networks (such as AlexNet) trended to detect better high-quality ECG excerpts and deep CNN models to identify better noisy ECG segments. The networks with a moderate depth of about 20 layers presented the best balanced performance on both groups of ECG excerpts. Indeed, GoogLeNet (with a depth of 22 layers) obtained very close values of sensitivity and specificity about 87%. It also maintained a misclassification rate of AF episodes similar to AlexNet and an acceptable computation time, thus constituting the best alternative for quality assessment of wearable, long-term ECG recordings acquired from patients with paroxysmal AF.  © 2013 IEEE.;Atrial fibrillation--deep learning--long-term ECG monitoring--machine learning--signal quality assessment;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Convolution--Deep learning--Diseases--Learning algorithms--Neural networks--Wearable technology--Atrial fibrillation--Biomedical monitoring--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Long-term electrocardiogram monitoring--Machine-learning--Paroxysmal atrial fibrillations--Quality assessment--Recording--Signal quality assessment--Electrocardiograms;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85173060778

Regarding the prediction of myocardial infarction, the traditional method is judged by the expertise and experience of medical personnel, but this method may lead to inaccurate results due to differences in judgment criteria, while using deep learning methods to study myocardial infarction facilitates the processing of features and can improve the accuracy of diagnosing the disease. In this paper, we propose a CNN_SVM model of convolutional neural network combined with support vector machine to predict myocardial infarction. A total of 87 features are obtained based on the vital signs and biochemical examinations of patients in the MIMIC data set. For these features, the CNN_SVM model firstly performs PCA dimensionality reduction by mapping the data from high dimension to low dimension to reduce the dimensionality of the features and retain as much information as possible to complete the dimensionality reduction, and finally obtains 45 data features--secondly, the last layer of the CNN model, Softmax classification layer, is replaced with SVM classification, and the final results are two kinds, namely myocardial infarction and non-myocardial infarction, respectively.

Diagnosis and prevention of heart disease require detection and awareness of risk factors. Disease progression modeling and clinical decision-making can both benefit from the automatic identification of these risk markers from clinical records. Many studies have tried, without success, to uncover the characteristics that put people at risk for cardiovascular disease. Many hybrid systems have been suggested that attempt to integrate knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches, however due to the usage of Machine Learning, rules, and dictionaries, methods, they frequently require substantial human input. Natural language processing and deep learning methods can be used to extract useful information from clinical tales. By using state-of-the-art methods involving stacked word embeddings to the 2014 i2b2 challenge, this article hopes to contribute to the state of the art in this area. The suggested model makes use of a stacking method that combines different embeddings (CHARACTER-BERT Embedding) to better understand the data.The application of this method to the i2b2 cardiovascular risk factors challenges dataset resulted in significant enhancement of our model's performance. An F1 score of 92.65% is an excellent result. When compared to competing models and systems created for the 2014 i2b2 challenge, our proposed model fares exceptionally well. © 2023 IEEE.;BERT--Deep Learning Cardiovascular Disease--NLP--Risk Assessment--Risk factors;Automation--Behavioral research--Cardiology--Decision making--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Embeddings--Hybrid systems--Natural language processing systems--BERT--Cardiovascular disease--Deep learning cardiovascular disease--Disease progression modelling--Embeddings--Heart disease--Language processing--Natural languages--Risk factors--Risks assessments--Risk assessment;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85181536442

Despite the attention that automatic detection of arrhythmias based on electrocardiogram (ECG) has received, static features used in traditional methods fail to adequately describe the various weak changes of the ECG, resulting in significant but weak pathological information being overlooked. Although deep learning (DL) extracted features demonstrate efficiency in arrhythmia classification, the interpretability of DL methods remains challenging. In this study, we propose a novel and efficient interpretable feature for arrhythmia classification, heartbeat dynamics. It models morphological changes in the heartbeat, and is more sensitive to weak heartbeat variations, and reflects underlying dynamical changes throughout the cardiac cycle at the electrophysiological level. To evaluate its efficiency for arrhythmia classification, we conducted experiments on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, using three classical classifiers: k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). Our proposed method achieves 99.41% accuracy, 99.10% precision, 98.84% recall, and 0.9897 F1 score with KNN as the classifier, comparable to or better than most DL-based methods. These results indicate that heartbeat dynamics has a strong ability to discriminate between different classes of heartbeats. We anticipate that the heartbeat dynamics feature will enhance the generalization capacity of the arrhythmia detection algorithm when integrated with other static features.  © 2013 IEEE.;arrhythmia detection--deterministic learning--ECG--heartbeat dynamics;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Deep learning--Diseases--Dynamics--Efficiency--Electrophysiology--Feature extraction--Heart--Nearest neighbor search--Support vector machines--Arrhythmia--Arrhythmia classification--Arrhythmia detection--Cardiovascular disease--Deterministic learning--Features extraction--Heart beats--Heartbeat dynamics--Recording--Static features--Electrocardiograms;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85168289424

Although it is necessary to detect and treat CVDs in their early stages, only 67% of heart diseases could be predicted by medical professionals. Motivated by recent advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that have ramified in a variety of industries, in this paper, we utilize three novel GNN models, including Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), GraphSAGE, and Graph Attention Network (GAT), to conduct the heart disease prediction task, comprised of two stages: table-to-graph transformation and Graph Neural Networks prediction. Experimental results show significant improvements with the utilization of GNNs compared with three novel Machine Learning models: Logistic Regression (LR), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and GAT performs optimally among the three GNN models.

Despite the fact that several techniques have been created for illness classification and privacy protection for safe data transfer, most of these techniques still have problems with precise decision making. In the field of clinical data investigation, the expectation of cardiovascular activity is a fundamental test. Artificial intelligence (AI) has matured into a useful tool for sifting through the mountain of data produced by medical professionals and health organisations to make informed decisions and forecasts. Machine learning techniques are helping doctors better predict heart attacks, and this has led many people to alter their behaviour in the future to avoid a similar fate. This study looks at two data sets, one from UCI and one from Kaggle, to make predictions about cardiovascular illness. The results obtained by applying the suggested model to these two datasets are competitive with current approaches. The heart disease prediction model presented here makes use of a Dual path network with recurrent convolutional cascades. Both the individual channel and the inter-channel connection are taken into account when employing LSTM. Then, layers that are completely interconnected occur. For this reason, the proposed system outperforms preexisting smart heart disease prediction systems by a wide margin, with an accuracy of 91.7% and 93.7%, respectively, when tested on the UCI and Kaggle datasets, respectively. © 2023 IEEE.;Artificial Intelligence--Deep convolutional neural network--heart disease monitoring scheme--Internet of things--Long Short-Term Memory;Behavioral research--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Computer aided diagnosis--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Decision making--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Forecasting--Heart--Internet of things--Learning systems--Long short-term memory--Clinical data--Convolutional neural network--Decisions makings--Deep convolutional neural network--Disease classification--Disease monitoring--Heart disease--Heart disease monitoring scheme--Medical health--Privacy protection--Data transfer;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85168772517

Its high fatality-rate catalysis nearly 17 million deaths worldwide. Prompt diagnosis assists in treating the disease at the right time to intercept mortality. Analyzing the existence and absence of the disease can be done using a variety of machine learning and deep learning techniques. In this review paper the complete procedure to make intelligent model is discussed. The UCI dataset is used in this project to classify cardiac disease using logistic regression techniques. To enhance the execution of the model, pre-processing of data by uncluttering the dataset, detecting the missing values is done and feature selection was accomplished by correlation with the target value for all the features. The distinctly positive correlated features were chosen. Then classification is performed by splitting the dataset into training data and testing data in the ratio of 80:20 split-up. The designed model secured 83.6% accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed model was thoroughly gratifying and was competent to predict evidence of having heart disease in a certain individual which exhibited quality precision (77%) and recall (89%). This heart disease prediction system amplifies medical care and mitigates the cost.

Diagnosing heart disorders is not an easy process that requires accuracy and proficiency. The goal of this research is to figure out which patients are more prone to develop heart disease depending on a variety of medical characteristics. Using the medical attributes of the person, we created a prediction model for heart disease to determine if a person is possibly to be detected with heart disease or not. We employed a variety of machine learning (ML) algorithms and one Deep Learning (DL) method for predicting and classifying whether patients have heart disease or not. To govern how the proposed DL model may be utilized for the improvement of the accuracy of heart disease prediction in any patient, a very useful strategy was applied. The proposed model's strength was highly satisfactory, as it was capable of predicting evidence of having a heart condition in a specific patient utilizing DL and the ML Model (Random-Forest-Classifier) that had high accuracies when compared to other employed classifiers. The proposed DL methodology for predicting heart disease is going to improve medical care while lowering costs. This research provides important information that can help us anticipate who will develop heart disease conditions.

The latter also significantly relies on adequately utilizing the hospital resources to deliver quality treatment and care. The provision of quality care merits the reduction of the average duration of patient stay, especially for intensive care units (ICU) where patients are in critical condition. Knowing the length of patient stay can thus serve as an indicator of hospital efficiency and help drastically improve hospital resource utilization. Also, extensive hospital stay usually denotes prolonged bed rest, the primary cause of pulmonary embolism (PE). We have also taken into cognizance that despite recent advancements in hospital infrastructures, cardiovascular disorders are a leading cause of mortality, among which heart failure (HF) and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have lately gained prominence. The advent of electronic health records (EHR) has allowed the usage of machine learning prediction algorithms to determine various health disorders from patient data. Therefore, we have developed sequential deep neural networks capable of predicting HF, STEMI, and PE from patients’ demographic data, prior medical history, and initial lab parameters, with an AUC of 0.867, 0.861, and 0.761, respectively. We have also developed neural networks for predicting Mortality with an AUC of 0.985 and Duration of ICU and Hospital Stay with Mean Absolute Error of 2.03 and 2.54, respectively, by adding doctors’ diagnoses of comorbidities to patient records. We have designed a web application that can be deployed in a hospital and used to test these models on real-time patient data. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;Hospital stay--ICU stay--Mortality--Neural networks--Web application;Cardiology--Deep neural networks--Diagnosis--Forecasting--Hospital data processing--Intensive care units--Multilayer neural networks--Web services--Heart failure--Hospital stay--Intensive care unit stay--Mortality--Myocardial Infarction--Neural-networks--Pulmonary embolism--Real- time--WEB application--Web applications--Efficiency;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85172239475

Heart failure can be predicted early, which can increase mortality rates. In this context, numerous classification techniques are described in the literature. As a result, it has turned into a difficult issue in the healthcare domain. In this paper, a deep learning-based classifier is proposed for heart failure detection. Additionally, pre-processing steps like normalization and feature encoding strategies are introduced in a novel way to enhance the performance of the suggested classifier. To eliminate the struggle of hyper-parameters selection, grid-search is used. To show the robustness of the proposed classifier, a standard heart disease dataset is utilized, and results are obtained under various training-validation-testing ratios. The findings show that the performance of the proposed classifier is better than the methods currently in use for classifying heart disease. The suggested classifier might be employed as a tool to help experts make early predictions about heart disease.  © 2023 IEEE.;Classifier--Deep neural network--Heart failure detection--Machine learning;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Diseases--Heart--Statistical tests--Causes of death--Classification technique--Failure detection--Healthcare domains--Heart disease--Heart failure--Heart failure detection--Machine-learning--Mortality rate--Performance--Deep neural networks;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85166232735

This research study presents a novel methodology for predicting Cardiovascular Diseases by employing a, recently developed, metaheuristic optimisation algorithm within a neural network framework. The Coati Optimisation Algorithm (COA) is employed in an artificial neural network (ANN) to enhance the predictive accuracy of outcomes related to Cardiovascular Diseases. The enhanced performance of the COA can be ascribed to its adept utilisation of both exploration and exploitation phenomena. This research employs publicly available datasets pertaining to heart and stroke disorders, integrating two datasets focused on heart disease and one dataset focused on stroke disease. A comparison analysis is undertaken between the proposed COA-ANN and existing approaches, namely Particle Swarm Optimizer based ANN (PSO-ANN), Grey Wolf Optimizer based ANN (GWO-ANN), and backpropagation based ANN (BP-ANN). The findings of the study indicate that the COA-ANN model exhibits the highest level of predictive accuracy. The COAANN outperformed the other three networks, namely GWOANN, PSO-ANN, and BP-ANN, with an average accuracy of 98.43%. As a result, the utilisation of the COA-ANN leads to an improvement in predictive accuracy for these datasets, with an increase of up to 2.64%. Additional assessment metrics, such as F1-Score, Precision, and Recall, provide more insight into the balanced performance of the COA-ANN architecture when applied to imbalanced class datasets. These results prove that the integration of nature-inspired algorithms with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is a promising direction for future research. © 2023 IEEE.;Artificial Neural Network--Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs)--Machine Learning--Metaheuristic Algorithms;Biomimetics--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Learning systems--Network architecture--Particle swarm optimization (PSO)--Cardiovascular disease--Global health--Learning architectures--Machine-learning--Meta-heuristics algorithms--Optimization algorithms--Particle swarm optimizers--Performance--Predictive accuracy--Neural networks;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85184854173

RHD is manageable and treatable with early detection. However, multiple countries across the globe suffer from a scarcity of experienced physicians who can perform screening at large scales. Advancements in machine learning and signal processing have paved way for Phonocardiogram (PCG)-based automatic heart sound classification. The direct implication of such methods is that it is possible to enable a person without specialized training to detect potential cardiac conditions with just a digital stethoscope. Hospitalization or life-threatening situations can be dramatically reduced via such early screenings. Towards this, we conducted a case study amongst a population from a particular geography using machine learning and deep learning methods for the detection of murmur in heart sounds. The methodology consists of first pre-processing and identifying normal vs. abnormal heart sound signals using 3 state-of-the-art methods. The second step further identifies the murmur to be systolic or diastolic by capturing the auscultation location. Abnormal findings are then sent for early attention of clinicians for proper diagnosis. The case study investigates the efficacy of the automated method employed for early screening of potential RHD and initial encouraging results of the study are presented. © 2023 IEEE.;;Algorithms--Heart Auscultation--Heart Diseases--Heart Murmurs--Heart Sounds--Humans--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Heart--Learning systems--Phonocardiography--Signal processing--Cardiovascular disease--Case-studies--Causes of death--Condition--Early warning--Heart sounds--Large-scales--Machine-learning--Rheumatic heart disease--Signal-processing--algorithm--heart auscultation--heart disease--heart murmur--heart sound--human--Developing countries;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;38083243;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85179649232

This ideal vision depends, however, on the synergy between cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, cardiac health practitioners, other health professionals, and data scientists. New cardiological and cardiac surgery knowledge will come from unsupervised or self-supervised learning that mitigates the burden of clinicians involved in cardiovascular research projects. Deep learning must occur within the context of a cognitive architecture for future dividends in cardiovascular medicine. Artificial intelligence in imaging will advance exponentially as novel imaging technologies such as few-shot learning, generative adversarial networks, and transfer learning are adopted. In addition, artificial intelligence will converge with emerging technologies such as extended reality to enable medical education and clinical training in cardiology and cardiac surgery. The advent of digital twin technology will facilitate a higher quality of patient care and clinical research that will accelerate with federated and swarm learning. Artificial intelligence and its adoption may be slowed, however, by a lack of adequate access to cardiac healthcare data, specifically a lack of population disease data from cardiac images, biomarkers, and other phenotypic expressions of cardiovascular disease. Artificial intelligence will also face the daunting challenges of clinician education and adoption and legal, regulatory, ethical, and financial issues. A cohort of dually trained and educated cardiologists or cardiac surgeon-data scientists can accelerate the aforementioned dimensions as essential liaisons for both domains. The best dividend from future artificial intelligence in cardiology and cardiac surgery is, perhaps, a reclaiming of humanity in cardiovascular medicine. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Especially in Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD), the use of ML is indispensable to reducing human errors. Enormous studies focused on disease prediction but depending on multiple parameters, further investigations are required to upgrade the clinical procedures. Multi-layered implementation of ML also called Deep Learning (DL) has unfolded new horizons in the field of clinical diagnostics. DL formulates reliable accuracy with big datasets but the reverse is the case with small datasets. This paper proposed a novel method that deals with the issue of less data dimensionality. Inspired by the regression analysis, the proposed method classifies the data by going through three different stages. In the first stage, feature representation is converted into probabilities using multiple regression techniques, the second stage grasps the probability conclusions from the previous stage and the third stage fabricates the final classifications. Extensive experiments were carried out on the Cleveland heart disease dataset. The results show significant improvement in classification accuracy. It is evident from the comparative results of the paper that the prevailing statistical ML methods are no more stagnant disease prediction techniques in demand in the future. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

Readmission worsens the life quality of patients due to economic and psychological burdens. Therefore, readmission prediction for patients is important to prevent unnecessary readmissions. We used a feature tokenizer transformer (FT-transformer) to predict readmission by embedding all features and analyzing via transformer encoder. Our experiment with 615 HF patients outperformed conventional machine learning models, achieving an area under the curve of 0.7434 within 28 days, 0.7063 within 3 months, and 0.7039 within 6 months.

In recent years, smartwatches in healthcare monitoring have proliferated. This inspired the IoMT (IoT) network. Early disease identification by the IoMT reduces mortality. Clinical statistics must address cardiovascular disease prediction. The planned study would employ machine learning to identify heart disease risk factors. Several heart disease studies have shown limited accuracy. This research develops a cardiovascular disease diagnosis model using AI and IoT convergence. The model includes data collection, preliminary processing, classification, and parameter tuning. Wearables and other Internet of Things devices, including sensors, seamlessly gather data, which artificial intelligence uses to identify ailments. The recommended technique uses a Cuttlefish-based Cascaded Long Short-Term Memory (MCFA-CLSTM) model for illness diagnosis. MCFA adjusts CLSTM model 'weights' and 'bias' parameters. This improves medical data classification. MCFA improves CLSTM model diagnostics. Healthcare data verified the MCFA-CLSTM model. The MCFA-LSTM model diagnosed cardiac illness with 97.26% accuracy.

There are various factors that contribute to the onset of heart failure, such as the nature of chest pain, blood pressure at rest, levels of cholesterol in the bloodstream, fasting blood sugar levels, results of resting electrocardiograms, attainment of maximum heart rate, angina triggered by exercise, oldpeak value, and the incline of the ST segment during peak exercise. Many research studies have been conducted using machine learning to obtain more accurate and effective predictions of heart failure. There are various machine learning algorithms that can be used for heart failure prediction. The algorithms used in this study are Gaussian Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Deep Learning, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Extra Trees Classifier. Additionally, several sampling techniques were applied in this study, including Random Oversampling, Random Undersampling, Tomek Links, SMOTE and ENN for heart failure prediction. To obtain the best heart failure prediction, validated data on potential factors for heart failure occurrence is required. One platform that provides datasets on heart failure prediction is Kaggle, which has been widely utilized by researchers. In this study, the heart failure prediction dataset was processed using a comparison of several binary preprocessing techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy rates. From the conducted research, it was found that by preprocessing the data using Robust Scaler and applying the ENN Sampling with KNN algorithm, the highest accuracy rate of 92.61% was achieved on the heart failure prediction cases. © 2023 IEEE.;Heart Failure Prediction--Kaggle--Machine Learning;Blood--Cardiology--Decision trees--Deep learning--Electrocardiograms--Forecasting--Heart--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Logistic regression--Support vector machines--Accuracy rate--Chest pain--Failures prediction--Heart disease--Heart failure--Heart failure prediction--High-accuracy--Kaggle--Machine learning algorithms--Machine-learning--Blood pressure;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85186531016

The enormously growing complications of chronic diseases such as congestive heart failure, neurological ailments, various forms of cancer, lifestyle disorders and respiratory pathologies demand rapid prognosis, quality diagnostic techniques and efficient treatment decisions. Prognosis that foretells the likelihood of a disease is very crucial in the near future. The rapidly growing population has to sustain the pandemics of the past, present and the future, while the onset of new pandemics like COVID-19 and monkeypox has enforced a severe toll on the health and economy of the world nations. With the rapidly changing advancements in biomedical data, data science and personalised genomics, early prognosis to chronic diseases is achievable. High-throughput multiomics technology that combines genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenetics and metabolomics has begun revolutionising biomedical research by unravelling the hidden molecular mechanisms and cellular responses of pathologies. The profound impact of multiomics has been divulged in cancer, rare disease research, neurological disorders and mitochondrial disease. The real spearhead is learning and processing the abundant biomedical data that are generated. The computational methods that involve machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence come to the rescue, offering solutions by integrating information from multiomics, histopathological images, X-ray images, scan reports, biochemical and other clinical practices. Few of the machine learning models implemented in disease prognosis are in clinical trials. One such method is a prediction model for cardiac surgery associated-acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) that determines long- and short-term mortality of patients to allow early identification of kidney injury post a cardiac surgery (NCT04966598). An artificial intelligence–based model is under clinical trials to process clinical records of heart ailments (cardio mining AI) from electronic medical data (NCT05176769). To identify the prognosis of sepsis, plasma metabolome, immunocytokines and single-nucleotide polymorphisms data are compared with other pathogen infections. Multiple machine learning algorithms are being examined under clinical trials by integrating multiomics data, clinical indicators and released cytokines types (NCT05305469). Currently there are few medical devices approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to support health care diagnosis. Some of them are Arterys Cardio DL, EnsoSleep, Guardian Connect System and AI-ECG Platform to assist in radiology, neurology, endocrinology and cardiology, respectively. Thus, computational pathology, multiomic biomedical data coupled with machine learning algorithms have the potential to offer prognosis, personalised rapid diagnosis and efficient treatment plans for chronic illnesses. © 2023 CRC Press.;;;CRC Press;;Book chapter;Scopus;2-s2.0-85180914000

By harnessing the nuanced capabilities of phonocardiography, this device captures intricate heart sounds, subsequently processed through advanced machine learning algorithms. Traditional stethoscopes, although indispensable, might miss subtle anomalies – a lacuna this digital counterpart addresses by meticulously analyzing phonocardiographic data for the slightest deviations indicative of cardiac anomalies. As the digital stethoscope delves into this trove of aural cues, the machine learning component discerns patterns and irregularities often imperceptible to human auditors. The confluence of these digital acoustics and computational analytics not only augments the accuracy of early heart disease diagnosis but also facilitates the archival of this data, engendering a continuous, longitudinal assessment of cardiac health. The initial foray into real-world application registered an encouraging precision rate, cementing its potential as an invaluable asset in preemptive cardiac care.

The development of smart healthcare services is a direct result of the advancements in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), wearable sensors, and communication technologies that have occurred in this technological era. The Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare also helps bring down the cost of many different diseases by analysing data quickly and thoroughly.

Current advances in the field of ML have led to latest method in deep neural networks, resulting great success in various pattern identification tasks like as image classification and object detection. Meanwhile, more and more medical fields are turning to machine learning techniques to process medical signals to aid physicians in diagnosis. Unlike conventional images, sounds, and other signals, medical data is often difficult to capture on a large scale. To overcome this problem, we proposed a CNN-based model for HF classification using unsupervised contrastive learning. Specifically, this paper utilizes a Resnet-18 like model with proposed channel & temporal attention module (CTA-Module). We also utilize the unsupervised based learning during the training procedure. Using contrastive learning, we maximize the feature distances of different subjects while minimizing the feature distances of the same subjects to perform unsupervised learning. It ensures that only the normal signals are utilized during the training procedure. The result shows our proposed method achieved the SOTA accuracy using public dataset. © 2023 IEEE.;Contrastive Learning--ECG signal--Heart failure;Cardiology--Deep neural networks--Electrocardiography--Health risks--Learning systems--Medical imaging--Unsupervised learning--'current--Contrastive learning--ECG signals--Failure detection--Feature distance--Heart failure--Human health--Images classification--Pattern identification--Training procedures--Object detection;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85173616432

Accurately predicting cardiac disease is essential for effective prevention and treatment. In this study, we offer a technique based on deep learning for predicting heart disease that outperforms several other machine learning models which includes logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, Gaussian naive Bayes, and multi-layer perceptron. Our model architecture comprises multiple layers of 1D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a max pooling layer applied after every two 1D convolutional neural network layers. Following these layers, we incorporate a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer and a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layer. Additionally, the model includes two dense layers with softmax activation. To mitigate overfitting, we employ regularization techniques such as batch normalization and kernel regularization. For training and evaluation, we utilize the Cleveland dataset, which consists of 303 samples and 14 features encompassing patient demographics, medical history, and laboratory test results. Prior to training, we preprocess the data and perform normalization using standard scalar. Our model achieves an impressive accuracy of 93.3% in predicting heart disease, which demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning for this task.

Factors like age, sex, cholesterol level, sugar level, and heart rate influence heart problems, making expert evaluation challenging due to the high number of variables. This manuscript proposes a novel approach using deep learning methods and feature augmentation techniques for evaluating patient's risk of cardiovascular disease. The results show a significant improvement, achieving a precision of 90%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods by 4.4%. Given the complexity and severity of cardiovascular diseases, an efficient and accurate heart attack prediction system becomes crucial. In this context, the paper utilizes Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) as a powerful classification algorithm in the domain of deep learning to predict the likelihood of heart-related diseases in patients. The proposed model combines deep learning and data mining to provide accurate results with minimal errors, addressing the limitations of existing medical data mining and machine learning techniques.

Repeated structuring & learning procedure (RS&LP) is a constructive algorithm able to automatically create artificial neural networks (ANN)--it relies on three parameters, namely maximal number of hidden layers (MNL), initializations (MNI) and confirmations (MNC), arbitrarily set by the user. The aim of this study is to evaluate RS&LP robustness to varying values of parameters and to identify an optimized combination of parameter values for HF diagnosis. To this aim, the Leiden University Medical Center HF database was used. The database is constituted by 129 serial ECG pairs acquired in patients who experienced myocardial infarction--48 patients developed HF at follow-up (cases), while 81 remained clinically stable (controls). Overall, 15 ANNs were created by considering 13 serial ECG features as inputs (extracted from each serial ECG pair), 2 classes as outputs (cases/controls), and varying values of MNL (1, 2, 3, 4 and 10), MNI (50, 250, 500, 1000 and 1500) and MNC (2, 5, 10, 20 and 50). The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic did not significantly vary with varying parameter values (P ≥ 0.09). The optimized combination of parameter values, identified as the one showing the highest AUC, was obtained for MNL = 3, MNI = 500 and MNC = 50 (AUC = 86 %--ANN structure: 3 hidden layers of 14, 14 and 13 neurons, respectively). Thus, RS&LP is robust, and the optimized ANN represents a potentially useful clinical tool for a reliable automatic HF diagnosis. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd;Artificial Neural Network--Deep Learning--Heart Failure--Machine Learning--Repeated Structuring and Learning Procedure--Serial Electrocardiography;Deep neural networks--Electrocardiograms--Heart--Learning systems--Multilayer neural networks--Areas under the curves--Deep learning--Failure Diagnosis--Heart failure--Hidden layers--Learning procedures--Machine-learning--Optimized combinations--Repeated structuring and learning procedure--Serial electrocardiography--area under the curve--Article--artificial neural network--computer assisted diagnosis--controlled study--electrocardiography--heart failure--heart infarction--human--learning algorithm--major clinical study--repeated structuring and learning procedure--Cardiology;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85138094006

AI modalities have expanded feet to the specialty of pediatric cardiology as well. We conducted a scoping review searching the Scopus, Embase, and PubMed databases covering the recent literature between 2002–2022. We found that the use of neural networks and machine learning has significantly improved the diagnostic value of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiograms, computer tomography scans, and electrocardiographs, thus augmenting the clinicians’ diagnostic accuracy of pediatric heart diseases. The use of AI-based prediction algorithms in pediatric cardiac surgeries improves postoperative outcomes and prognosis to a great extent. Risk stratification and the prediction of treatment outcomes are feasible using the key clinical findings of each CHD with appropriate computational algorithms. Notably, AI can revolutionize prenatal prediction as well as the diagnosis of CHD using the EMR (electronic medical records) data on maternal risk factors. The use of AI in the diagnostics, risk stratification, and management of CHD in the near future is a promising possibility with current advancements in machine learning and neural networks. However, the challenges posed by the dearth of appropriate algorithms and their nascent nature, limited physician training, fear of over-mechanization, and apprehension of missing the ‘human touch’ limit the acceptability. Still, AI proposes to aid the clinician tomorrow with precision cardiology, paving a way for extremely efficient human-error-free health care. © 2022 by the authors.;artificial intelligence--congenital heart diseases--machine learning--pediatric cardiac surgery--pediatric cardiology;artificial intelligence--artificial neural network--cancer prognosis--cardiovascular magnetic resonance--cardiovascular mortality--child--childhood disease--clinical outcome--computer assisted tomography--congenital heart disease--deep learning--diagnostic accuracy--diagnostic test accuracy study--diagnostic value--echocardiography--electrocardiogram--electrocardiography--electronic medical record--Embase--fear--health care--heart murmur--heart surgery--human--image processing--machine learning--medical education--Medline--meta analysis--observational study--patient care--pediatric cardiology--pediatric surgery--personalized medicine--physician--postoperative period--predictive value--prenatal diagnosis--prognosis--program acceptability--Review--risk assessment--risk factor--Scopus--systematic review--thorax radiography--treatment outcome--treatment planning;MDPI;;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85143595194

Electrocardiogram analysis methods using deep neural networks have been widely used in recent years and are becoming more efficient and accurate than traditional machine learning methods. Exercise electrocardiogram is useful in the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease, but the study of long-term ischemic heart disease prediction based on exercise electrocardiogram is still limited. To investigate the early predictive value of exercise electrocardiogram in addition to basic physiological data in incident ischemic heart disease in a random general population sample followed from 40 to 69 years of age, a multi-modal fusion model is designed to predict ischemic heart disease based on machine learning methods. With the deep feature extractor and multi-modal feature fusion module, the proposed model performance is better than the traditional expert feature based methods and only deep neural networks. This implies that this proposed model may be improved in a contemporary era of ischemic heart disease prevention with the gradually declining incidence of ischemic heart disease. © 2023 The Authors.

Any blockage in blood vessel of carotid artery located in the neck region can predict the risk of heart failure. Carotid Intima-Media Thickness (CIMT) measured from carotid artery supports in the estimation of heart failure. In this study, cardiovascular risk is considered based on the CIMT thickness of carotid artery blood vessels. In this paper, CIMT and Framingham risk score (FRS) boundary have been determined for both normal and cardiovascular disease (CVD) subjects, which aids in the prediction of heart failure. For 55 subjects with normal condition and 55 subjects with CVD disease, CIMT values were measured by utilizing an effective ultrasound examination system. Biochemical parameters were also measured for all the 110 subjects to predict the FRS score. Student t-test and Spearmans correlation performed showed significant results with p-value less than 0.01 for CIMT, biochemical parameters and FRS score. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) has been plotted for measured CIMT value and FRS value indicates with an accuracy of 71%. The performance was also determined by comparing various classification techniques using machine learning and deep learning. Results observed through machine learning show that random forest, multilayer perceptron and K-nearest neighbor classifiers used in classification techniques give more superior accuracy of 79% and sensitivity of 78%. To improvise the investigation, deep learning technique using carotid artery ultrasound image of 1909 dataset has been used. Deep learning CNN architecture using VGG19 implemented gave an accuracy of 98% with sensitivity 98% and specificity 99%. It was also observed from the 20% data used for validation that 199 subjects are without risk of MI and 178 subjects were predicted with a risk of MI in future. Further relative risk analysis performed with FRS and CIMT showed that a person with low risk of FRS has 26% chances of getting abnormal CIMT and MI risk in future.  © 2022 National Taiwan University.;Carotid intima media thickness--Framingham risk score--Machine learning--Myocardial infarction--Statistical analysis--Transfer learning;Blood--Cardiology--Decision trees--Deep learning--Forecasting--Heart--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Nearest neighbor search--Risk assessment--Ultrasonic applications--hemoglobin A1c--high density lipoprotein--low density lipoprotein--triacylglycerol--Cardiovascular disease--Carotid artery--Carotid intima-media thickness--Framingham risk score--Heart failure--Learning techniques--Machine-learning--Myocardial Infarction--Risk score--Transfer learning--adult--Article--B scan--Bayesian learning--blood sampling--body height--body mass--body weight--cardiovascular risk--carotid artery--carotid intima-media thickness--cholesterol blood level--controlled study--convolutional neural network--deep learning--diagnostic accuracy--diagnostic test accuracy study--diastolic blood pressure--fasting blood glucose level--Framingham risk score--glucose blood level--heart failure--heart infarction--hemoglobin blood level--human--k nearest neighbor--lipoprotein blood level--machine learning--major clinical study--middle aged--multilayer perceptron--postprandial state--prediction--random forest--risk assessment--sensitivity and specificity--support vector machine--systolic blood pressure--transfer of learning--triacylglycerol blood level--Blood vessels;World Scientific;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85133942607

According to the California Association for Diabetes Investigation, by 2015, cardiovascular disease would be the primary cause of death in India, where 62 billion people live. Deficiencies in the heart's ability to pump blood to and from the rest of the body are the leading cause of cardiovascular disease. The healthcare industry is a prime example of a sector poised to greatly benefit from the availability of massive amounts of data and analytical insights. Increasingly, it will be important to extract medical data to predict and treat the high fatality rate caused by heart attacks. Every day, humanity generates terabytes worth of data. Medical errors with dire effects can be avoided only with high-quality services. Hospitals can reduce the price of expensive clinical testing by using decision support systems. Hospitals in the modern-day use hospital information systems to keep track of patient records. The health care sector generates vast amounts of data, but little of it is really put to good use. It will be important to adopt a new strategy to reduce costs and make accurate predictions about heart disease. To determine which machine learning and deep learning approaches are most useful and accurate for predicting and classifying cardiac illnesses, this article reviews the existing literature on the topic and subsequently tries to detect the most probable factors leading to heart disease. This study introduces and models an artificial neural network methodology for identifying potential cardiovascular disease risk factors. In this study, we examine and present the various full and partial correlations among risk attributes. In addition, a number of risk variables are analysed to generate a predicted list of risk features most likely to result in cardiovascular disease.  © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.;artificial neural network--back propagation--complete heart block--coronary heart diseases;Backpropagation--Cardiology--Cost reduction--Decision support systems--Deep learning--Diseases--Forecasting--Health care--Hospitals--Information use--Neural networks--Back Propagation--California--Cardiovascular disease--Causes of death--Complete heart block--Coronary heart disease--Early prediction--Healthcare industry--Heart disease--Mortality rate--Heart;De Gruyter Open Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85148703007

Early and accurate detection of heart failure is critical for impeding disease progression. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a test that records the rhythm and electrical activity of the heart and is used to detect HF. It is used to look for irregularities in the heart’s rhythm or electrical conduction, as well as a history of heart attacks, ischemia, and other conditions that may initiate HF. However, sometimes, it becomes difficult and time-consuming to interpret the ECG signal, even for a cardiac expert. This paper proposes two models to automatically detect HF from ECG signals: the first one introduces a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), while the second one suggests an extension of it by integrating a Support Vector Machine (SVM) layer for the classification at the end of the network. The proposed models provide a more accurate automatic HF detection using 2-s ECG fragments. Both models are smaller than previously proposed models in the literature when the architecture is taken into account, reducing both training time and memory consumption. The MIT-BIH and the BIDMC databases are used for training and testing the adopted models. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework by achieving an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of over 99% with blindfold cross-validation. The models proposed in this study can provide doctors with reliable references and can be used in portable devices to enable the real-time monitoring of patients. © 2022 by the authors.;binary classification--convolutional neural network--deep learning--electrocardiogram--heart failure--machine learning--support vector machine;Algorithms--Arrhythmias, Cardiac--Electrocardiography--Heart Failure--Humans--Neural Networks, Computer--Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted--Support Vector Machine--Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Heart--Learning systems--Multilayer neural networks--Oxygen supply--Signal detection--Support vector machines--Binary classification--Condition--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Electrocardiogram signal--Heart fail--Heart failure--Machine-learning--Neural network and support vector machines--Support vectors machine--algorithm--electrocardiography--heart arrhythmia--heart failure--human--signal processing--support vector machine--Electrocardiograms;MDPI;36501892;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85143827685

It enables healthcare providers to offer personalised patient care by looking into people's medical histories, symptoms, and test results. Doctors can create specialized treatments and administer medications that target ailments in individual people by using ML in medicine and healthcare. Healthcare companies can now get analyses based on patient electronic health information thanks to machine learning (ML).

This work presents an ECG classifier for variable leads as a contribution to the Computing in Cardiology Challenge/CinC Challenge 2021. It aims to integrate deep and classic machine learning features into a single model, exploring the proper structure and training procedure. Approach. From the initial 88 253 signals, only 84 210 were included. Low quality and unscored recordings were excluded. Three different database subsets of 40 365 recording each were created by dividing in three normal sinus rhythm and sinus bradycardia recordings. Each subset was used to train a different model with shared architecture integrated as an ensemble to provide the final classification through major voting. Models contained a deep branch composed of a modified ResNet with dilation convolutional layers and squeeze and excitation Block that took as input windowed ECG signals. This was concatenated with a wide branch that integrated 20 cardiac rhythm features into a fully connected 3-layered network. Three different training steps were studied: just the deep branch (D), wide integration and training (D+W), and a final fine tuning of the deep branch posterior to wide training (D+W+D). Main Results. Results obtained in a local test set formed by a stratified 12.5% split of the given full dataset were presented for 2-lead and 12-lead models. The best training method was the 3-step D + W + D procedure obtaining a challenge metric of 0.709 and 0.677 for 12 and 2-lead models respectively. Significance. Integration of handcrafted features and deep learning model not only may increase the generalization capacity of the network but also provide a path to add explicit information into the classification decision process. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work studying the training procedure to properly integrate both types of information for ECG signals classification. © 2022 The Author(s).

Myocardial infarction is frequently classified and diagnosed in medical treatment using MRI, yet this method is ineffective and prone to error. As a result, there are several implementation scenarios and clinical significance for employing deep learning to develop computer-aided algorithms to aid cardiologists in the routine examination of cardiac MRI. Methods: This research uses two distinct domain classifiers to address this issue and achieve domain adaptation between the particular field and the specific part is a problem Current research on environment adaptive systems cannot effectively obtain and apply classification information for unsupervised scenes of target domain images. Insufficient information interchange between specific domains and specific domains is a problem. In this study, two different domain classifiers are used to solve this problem and achieve domain adaption. To effectively mine the source domain images for classification understanding, an unsupervised MRI classification technique for myocardial infarction called CardiacCN is proposed, which relies on adversarial instructions related to the interpolation of confusion specimens in the target domain for the conflict of confusion specimens for the target domain classification task. Results: The experimental results demonstrate that the CardiacCN model in this study performs better on the six domain adaption tasks of the Sunnybrook Cardiac Dataset (SCD) dataset and increases the mean target area myocardial infarction MRI classification accuracy by approximately 1.2 percent. The classification performance of the CardiacCN model on the target domain does not vary noticeably when the temperature-controlled duration hyper-parameter rl falls in the region of 5–30. According to the experimental findings, the CardiacCN model is more resistant to the excitable rl. The CardiacCN model suggested in this research may successfully increase the accuracy of the source domain predictor for the target domain myocardial infarction clinical scanning classification in unsupervised learning, as shown by the visualization analysis infrastructure provision nurture. It is evident from the visualization assessment of embedded features that the CardiacCN model may significantly increase the source domain classifier's accuracy for the target domain's classification of myocardial infarction in clinical scans under unsupervised conditions. Conclusion: To address misleading specimens with the inconsistent classification of target-domain myocardial infarction medical scans, this paper introduces the CardiacCN unsupervised domain adaptive MRI classification model, which relies on adversarial learning associated with resampling target-domain confusion samples. With this technique, implicit image classification information from the target domain is fully utilized, knowledge transfer from the target domain to the specific domain is encouraged, and the classification effect of the myocardial ischemia medical scan is improved in the target domain of the unsupervised scene. © 2022;CardiacCN--Confrontational learning--Domain adaptation--Image classification--Myocardial infarction;Algorithms--Humans--Magnetic Resonance Imaging--Myocardial Infarction--Blood vessels--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Clinical research--Computer aided diagnosis--Computer aided instruction--Decision support systems--Deep learning--Heart--Image classification--Image enhancement--Interpolation--Knowledge management--Learning systems--Visualization--Cardiaccn--Classification informations--Confrontational learning--Diagnostic model--Domain adaptation--Domain adaptions--Images classification--Myocardial Infarction--Resampling--Target domain--Article--cardiologist--cardiovascular magnetic resonance--classification algorithm--deep learning--deep neural network--feature extraction--heart infarction--human--medical examination--nuclear magnetic resonance imaging--unsupervised machine learning--algorithm--diagnostic imaging--nuclear magnetic resonance imaging--Magnetic resonance imaging;Elsevier Ireland Ltd;36183637;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85138999241

The procedure is easy, fast, and non-invasive. But, artificially identifying and classifying heart disease is difficult, as manually examining the ECG signals is time-consuming. In recent years, a huge growth in the control of IoT can witness that gives a lot in the health care method as it allows continuous monitoring of patients but there is a requirement for advanced automatic monitoring methods for classifier of cardiac arrests. This article develops an automated arrhythmia classification using Harris Hawks Optimization-based DL (AC-HHODL) technique in an IoT environment. The AC-HHODL technique focuses on the identification and categorization of arrhythmia using ECG signals in the IoT environment. In the AC-HHODL technique, the MobileNetv2 model was executed for producing a collection of feature vectors. In addition, the HHO technique was exploited for the optimum hyperparameter adjustment of the MobileNetv2 model. Furthermore, least square support vector machine (LS -SVM) approach is applied for accurate arrhythmia classification. To validate the better performance of the AC-HHODL approach, the experiments were carried out on arrhythmia dataset. On the other hand, with respect to sensy, the AC-HHODL algorithm has managed to report increased sensy of 98.65% while the ResNet, ResNet-attention, DenseNet, VGG-16, and XGBoost approaches have exposed degraded sensy of 91.67%, 89.47%, 95.34%, 95.77% and 90.40% respectively. The simulation output inferred the improvised efficacy of the AC-HHODL technique over other models. © 2023 IEEE.;Arrhythmia classification--Deep learning--electrocardiogram (ECG) Signals--Harris Hawks optimization--Internet of Things;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Heart--Support vector machines--Arrhythmia classification--Automatic monitoring--Cardiovascular disease--Continuous monitoring--Deep learning--Electrocardiogram signal--Harris hawk optimization--Heart disease--Learning models--Optimisations--Internet of things;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85152436565

Automated extraction of CMR measurements from clinical reports that are typically stored as unstructured text in electronic health record systems would facilitate their use in research. Existing machine learning approaches either rely on large quantities of expert annotation or require the development of engineered rules that are time-consuming and are specific to the setting in which they were developed. Objective: We hypothesize that the use of pretrained transformer-based language models may enable label-efficient numerical extraction from clinical text without the need for heuristics or large quantities of expert annotations. Here, we fine-tuned pretrained transformer-based language models on a small quantity of CMR annotations to extract 21 CMR measurements. We assessed the effect of clinical pretraining to reduce labeling needs and explored alternative representations of numerical inputs to improve performance. Methods: Our study sample comprised 99,252 patients that received longitudinal cardiology care in a multi-institutional health care system. There were 12,720 available CMR reports from 9280 patients. We adapted PRAnCER (Platform Enabling Rapid Annotation for Clinical Entity Recognition), an annotation tool for clinical text, to collect annotations from a study clinician on 370 reports. We experimented with 5 different representations of numerical quantities and several model weight initializations. We evaluated extraction performance using macroaveraged F1-scores across the measurements of interest. We applied the best-performing model to extract measurements from the remaining CMR reports in the study sample and evaluated established associations between selected extracted measures with clinical outcomes to demonstrate validity. Results: All combinations of weight initializations and numerical representations obtained excellent performance on the gold-standard test set, suggesting that transformer models fine-tuned on a small set of annotations can effectively extract numerical quantities. Our results further indicate that custom numerical representations did not appear to have a significant impact on extraction performance. The best-performing model achieved a macroaveraged F1-score of 0.957 across the evaluated CMR measurements (range 0.92 for the lowest-performing measure of left atrial anterior-posterior dimension to 1.0 for the highest-performing measures of left ventricular end systolic volume index and left ventricular end systolic diameter). Application of the best-performing model to the study cohort yielded 136,407 measurements from all available reports in the study sample. We observed expected associations between extracted left ventricular mass index, left ventricular ejection fraction, and right ventricular ejection fraction with clinical outcomes like atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and mortality. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that a domain-agnostic pretrained transformer model is able to effectively extract quantitative clinical measurements from diagnostic reports with a relatively small number of gold-standard annotations. The proposed workflow may serve as a roadmap for other quantitative entity extraction. ©Pulkit Singh, Julian Haimovich, Christopher Reeder, Shaan Khurshid, Emily S Lau, Jonathan W Cunningham, Anthony Philippakis, Christopher D Anderson, Jennifer E Ho, Steven A Lubitz, Puneet Batra.;cardiac MRI--clinical outcomes--deep learning--machine learning--natural language processing--transformers;;JMIR Publications Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85140243563

However, the accuracy of auscultation relies on the professionalism of cardiologists. Doctors in remote areas may lack the experience to diagnose correctly. Therefore, it is necessary to design a system to assist with the diagnosis. This study proposed a computer-aided heart valve disease diagnosis system, including a heart sound acquisition module, a trained model for diagnosis, and software, which can diagnose four kinds of heart valve diseases. In this study, a training dataset containing five categories of heart sounds was collected, including normal, mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, and aortic stenosis heart sound. A convolutional neural network GoogLeNet and weighted KNN are used to train the models separately. For the model trained by the convolutional neural network, time series heart sound signals are converted into time-frequency scalograms based on continuous wavelet transform to adapt to the architecture of GoogLeNet. For the model trained by weighted KNN, features from the time domain and time-frequency domain are extracted manually. Then feature selection based on the chi-square test is performed to get a better group of features. Moreover, we designed software that lets doctors upload heart sounds, visualize the heart sound waveform, and use the model to get the diagnosis. Model assessments using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score indicators are done on two trained models. The results showed that the model trained by modified GoogLeNet outperformed others, with an overall accuracy of 97.5%. The average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score for diagnosing four kinds of heart valve diseases are 98.75%, 96.88%, 99.22%, and 97.99%, respectively. The computer-aided diagnosis system, with a heart sound acquisition module, a diagnostic model, and software, can visualize the heart sound waveform and show the reference diagnostic results. This can assist in the diagnosis of heart valve diseases, especially in remote areas, which lack skilled doctors.  © 2023 Si-ji Ding et al.;;Computers--Heart Auscultation--Heart Sounds--Heart Valve Diseases--Humans--Machine Learning--Cardiology--Computer aided diagnosis--Computer aided instruction--Computer software--Convolution--Frequency domain analysis--Machine learning--Statistical tests--Wavelet transforms--Acquisition modules--Computer-aided--Convolutional neural network--Diagnose system--Disease diagnosis--F1 scores--Heart sounds--Heart valve disease--Remote areas--Sound waveforms--aortic stenosis--Article--computer aided design--continuous wavelet transform--convolutional neural network--decision tree--deep neural network--diagnostic accuracy--feature extraction--feature selection--heart sound--human--information processing--k nearest neighbor--learning algorithm--machine learning--mitral valve prolapse--mitral valve regurgitation--mitral valve stenosis--sensitivity and specificity--software--support vector machine--training--transfer of learning--valvular heart disease--computer--heart auscultation--heart sound--machine learning--Heart;Hindawi Limited;36726774;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85147235502

In order to determine the most advantageous methods in this field, numerous techniques and studies have been carried out over the past few years. It should be mentioned that the majority of these cardiovascular illnesses are treatable with earlier detection and prediction. This paper suggests using an automated methodology to predict and classify the likelihood of cardiac arrests in a patient. Due to their collection from various sources, the Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are initially preprocessed by normalizing them to the [0 1] range. The significant features from these preprocessed signals are then extracted using Mel-Frequency Cepstrum (MFCC), Melspectrogram, MFCC Delta 1 & 2, MFCC Merge File, etc. We also propose a novel feature vector using ensemble of MFCC features. The features are then classified using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), TPOT and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). The proposed vector outperformed all other feature vectors and obtained highest accuracy of 95.8% via ANN. The study is conducted using publicly accessible dataset composed of approximately 52 thousand ECG signals. The suggested strategy is compared with existing techniques and the results indicate the robustness and effectiveness of our approach. Therefore, the proposed methodology can be effectively deployed in a clinical setting to classify ECG data and identify the risks likelihood of cardiac arrests in a patient.  © 2023 IEEE.;Cardiac Arrest Prediction--Deep Learning--Heart Disease Prediction--Machine Learning;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Electrocardiograms--Heart--Learning systems--Nearest neighbor search--Neural networks--Support vector machines--Vectors--Cardiac arrest--Cardiac arrest prediction--Cardiovascular disease--Deep learning--Electrocardiogram signal--Features vector--Heart disease--Heart disease prediction--Machine-learning--Mel frequency cepstrum--Forecasting;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85153567030

One type of heart disease is the occurrence of symptoms of arrhythmia, which is a condition in which the heartbeat rate is too fast, too slow, or irregular. In recent years, researchers have developed various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to classify various types of arrhythmias via electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. This monitoring aims to be an early treatment for various types of arrhythmia disorders, so that the proper detection of ECG deviations will assist doctors and other health professionals in taking appropriate medical action quickly and accurately. The classification proposed in this study is to classify 5 types of arrhythmia disorders from the MIT-BIH database based on AAMI rules using several CNN architectural learning models such as AlexNet, ResNet-50, InceptionNet, and VGG-16 by utilizing resampling techniques and Gaussian mixed models. The results show that the classification accuracy of each proposed model is 97.99% for AlexNet, 97.60% for ResNet-50, 97.59% for InceptionNet, and 97.55% for VGG-16. © 2023 IEEE.;alexnet--arrhythmia--deep learning--electrocardiogram--inceptionnet--resnet-50--vgg-16;Biomedical signal processing--Blood vessels--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Deep learning--Diseases--Learning systems--Alexnet--Arrhythmia--Cardiovascular disease--Deep learning--Electrocardiogram signal--Inceptionnet--Learning models--Premature death--Resnet-50--Vgg-16--Electrocardiograms;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85163108833

According to many studies, patients with a common cardiac problem are more prone to develop brain aneurysms. The expression “coronary illness” alludes to conditions that square veins and can prompt a cardiovascular failure, chest agony, or stroke. Heart conditions that influence the muscles, valves, or musicality of the heart lead to coronary illness, and the coronary supply route sidesteps a medical procedure or coronary mediation is utilized to resolve these issues.

Therefore, the prediction of in-hospital mortality of patients with HF is of paramount significance in providing clinical information to doctors. To improve the accuracy of prediction, this study constructed a prediction model for in-hospital mortality of patients with HF based on machine learning algorithms. Methods: We obtained the medical data of 1901 patients with HF from a public database and performed preprocessing to extract 19 variables as inputs of the prediction model. A prediction model was constructed based on the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and its performance was improved using the Optuna framework to optimize the LightGBM hyperparameters. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, five machine learning algorithms widely used in the field of biomedicine were selected for comparison: support vector machine, classification and regression tree, random forests, gradient boosting decision tree, and LightGBM. Further, we explained the proposed model based on Deep SHapley Additive exPlanations. We also quantified the importance of each variable and analyzed its correlation with the results. Results: The accuracy rate of Optuna-LightGBM was 92±1.44%, the precision rate was 83.71±8.34%, the recall rate was 69.46±11.18%, the F-measure was 74.81±6.55%, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 83.14±5%. The results show that this model outperformed other models on all evaluation indicators. Conclusions: The proposed method can be used to construct a prediction model for in-hospital mortality of patients with HF.

With the pressures for improved care and translation of the latest medical advances and knowledge to an actionable plan, clinical decision-making for cardiologists is challenging. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field in computer science that studies the design of intelligent agents which take the best feasible action in a situation. It incorporates the use of computational algorithms which simulate and perform tasks that traditionally require human intelligence such as problem solving and learning. Whilst medicine is arguably the last to apply AI in its everyday routine, cardiology is at the forefront of AI revolution in the medical field. The development of AI methods for accurate prediction of CVD outcomes, non-invasive diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD), detection of malignant arrythmias through wearables, and diagnosis, treatment strategies and prediction of outcomes for heart failure (HF) patients, demonstrates the potential of AI in future cardiology. With the advancements of AI, Internet of Things (IoT) and the promotion of precision medicine, the future of cardiology will be heavily based on these innovative digital technologies. Despite this, ethical dilemmas regarding the implementation of AI technologies in real-world are still unaddressed.

The method of predicting cardiac disease is exceedingly complex. It can only be done properly if the doctor has a lot of expertise and is well-versed in the condition. IoT-based illness prediction is a relatively recent technology for accurately classifying diseases based on sensor data. This system proposes an enhanced deep learning-based framework for predicting the heart disease. The general publicly available Hungarian heart disease dataset is utilized for the implementation, which includes heart disease related data collected from patients through IoT sensor devices. The input dataset is preprocessed using Median Studentized Residual approach for resolving error data and missing values. Preprocessed data values are feature selected by Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO) approach. The selected features are then classified into normal and abnormal by Modified Deep Long Short-Term Memory (MDLSTM). The modification in LSTM output is altered using Improved Spotted Hyena Optimization (ISHO) algorithm. The results are implemented in the working platform of Phyton with the metrics such as specificity, sensitivity, F-Score, Kappa value, Accuracy, BER and Execution time. The analyzed results shows that the implemented methodology is superior in the prediction of heart disease with an accuracy of 98.01% and reduced error rate of 91.11 compared with other existing techniques. © 2022;Classification--Harris hawk optimization (HHO)--Heart disease prediction--Improved spotted hyena optimization (ISHO)--Median studentized residual approach--Modified deep long short-term memory (MDLSTM)--Preprocessing;Algorithms--Deep Learning--Heart--Heart Diseases--Humans--Brain--Cardiology--Diseases--Heart--Internet of things--Long short-term memory--Medical applications--Harris hawk optimization--Heart disease--Heart disease prediction--Improved spotted hyena optimization--Median studentized residual approach--Modified deep long short-term memory--Optimisations--Preprocessing--Studentized residuals--accuracy--adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system--Article--calculation--classifier--deep learning--disease classification--disease severity--electrocardiography--fuzzy system--heart disease--internet of things--k nearest neighbor--learning algorithm--machine learning--modified slap swarm optimization--physical examination--prediction--support vector machine--algorithm--heart--heart disease--human--Forecasting;Elsevier Ltd;36564242;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85144568605

Regrettably, seeking medical experts to analyse big amount ECG signal consumes an inordinate number of medical resources. As a result, machine learning based approaches for identifying ECG characteristics have gradually gained popularity. However, these traditional approaches have some disadvantages, such as the need for manual feature recognition, complex representations, and a prolonged training period. In this article, we present a method for identifying the five classes of heart-beat categories in the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset using A Multi-layer Deep Learning Model (MLDLM) in compliance with the AAMI EC57 standard. The proposed MLDLM technique was tested using MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset which has 1,09,446 ECG heart-beats and sample frequency 125 Hz. This initial dataset contains the classes N, S, V, F, and Q.

Numerous lives could be saved by early detection of heart disease--however, periodic diagnostic data analysis faces a significant challenge in identifying heart diseases. An estimated 17.9 million people died from heart diseases in 2016, which represents 31% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85% were due to heart attack and stroke. In order to automate the analysis of large and complex datasets, machine learning algorithms and techniques have been used on a variety of medical datasets. The research paper analyzed the coronary heart disease dataset, and the performance of the classical machine learning models for classification of the heart disease are compared. In our proposed work, the predictions of heart disease are carried out using a semi-supervised approach with the deep learning models where the entity embedding layer is used for encoding the categorical features. The proposed model with embedding layers and pre-training gave an accuracy of 99% when real-time data was fed into it. This was found to be superior to the traditional machine learning model, Random Forest, which provides 94% accuracy. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Entity Embedding Layers--Heart Disease--Pre-training--Random Forest--Semi-Supervised Learning;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Embeddings--Heart--Embeddings--Entity embedding layer--Health concerns--Heart disease--Machine learning models--Mortality rate--Pre-training--Random forests--Semi-supervised--Semi-supervised learning--Large dataset;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85161177735

It is observed that the atrial arrhythmias and congestive heart failure are closely related, wherein, one promotes the other and their co-existence can increase the mortality rate. Timely diagnosis of these diseases is essential to prevent sudden cardiac failure. In this work, we employ a two-fold approach to classify arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, and normal sinus rhythm using ECG fragments. First, we use a traditional hand-crafted feature based model which involves extraction of a number of linear and non-linear features from the ECG fragments. The linear features capture the time-varying and scale of variability information, whereas the non-linear features help to extract the hidden complexity and quantify the uncertainty of the non-stationary signal. Second, an automatic feature learning based approach is employed which uses a pre-trained deep learning network to automatically extract the relevant detailed information from the ECG time–frequency representations. Finally, we explored the combined effect of the two approaches to diagnose the arrhythmias and congestive heart failure patterns. Additionally, this study makes novel use of the subject-level ECG classification. This work on Physionet database shows that the proposed combined system gives an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision of 99.06%, 99.14%, 99.68%, and 99.32%, respectively, which are better than the state-of-the-art systems.

Moreover, the persistent and prolonged complications of post-COVID-19 or long COVID are also putting extreme pressure on hospital authorities due to the constrained healthcare resources. Out of many long-lasting post-COVID-19 complications, heart disease has been realized as the most common among COVID-19 survivors. The motivation behind this research is the limited availability of the post-COVID-19 dataset. In the current research, data related to post-COVID complications are collected by personally contacting the previously infected COVID-19 patients. The dataset is preprocessed to deal with missing values followed by oversampling to generate numerous instances, and model training. A binary classifier based on a stacking ensemble is modeled with deep neural networks for the prediction of heart diseases, post-COVID-19 infection. The proposed model is validated against other baseline techniques, such as decision trees, random forest, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks. Results show that the proposed technique outperforms other baseline techniques and achieves the highest accuracy of 93.23%. Moreover, the results of specificity (95.74%), precision (95.24%), and recall (92.05%) also prove the utility of the adopted approach in comparison to other techniques for the prediction of heart diseases. © 2021, Ohmsha, Ltd. and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.;K-fold cross-validation--Machine learning--Post-COVID-19--Stacking ensemble;Cardiology--Decision trees--Deep neural networks--Forecasting--Health care--Support vector machines--Coronaviruses--Extreme pressure--Intelligent machine--K fold cross validations--Machine learning models--Machine-learning--Post-COVID-19--Prediction of heart disease--Stacking ensemble--Stackings--COVID-19;Springer;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85121302984

However, there aren't many efficient methods available to find hidden trends and linkages in e-health data. Medical diagnosis is a difficult process that has to be carried out precisely and effectively if people are to be saved. To lower the cost of performing clinical tests, an appropriate and accurate computer-based automated decision support system is required. The use of ML in health analytics has been proposed to anticipate precise patient data analysis. The data generated by the healthcare sector is not mined. Datasets containing patient risk factors can be utilised to create intelligent models in the medical industry by utilising data mining techniques. The growth of methods and tools for using data has surprised knowledge discovery in database. This study sheds light on machine learning and deep learning approaches used in disease detection. There are several data mining classifiers that have been developed recently for accurate and efficient illness diagnosis. The heart attack prediction system proposed in this research uses deep learning techniques, more especially Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), to forecast the patient's likelihood of developing heart-related disorders. The Deep Learning technique in Artificial Neural Networks is used by MLP, a particularly potent classification system. To provide reliable results with a minimal amount of error, the suggested model combines deep learning with data mining.  © 2023 IEEE.;cardiovascular disease prediction--Data mining--deep learning--machine learning--multi-layer perceptron;Cardiology--Data mining--Decision support systems--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Hospital data processing--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Medical computing--Multilayer neural networks--ANN algorithm--Cardiovascular disease--Cardiovascular disease prediction--Deep learning--E health--Ehealth--Learning techniques--Machine-learning--Multilayers perceptrons--Prediction-based--Forecasting;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85153336948

It can be treated successfully through a simple and accurate diagnosis. Getting the right diagnosis at the right time is very important for the treatment of heart failure. Currently, the conventional method of diagnosing heart disease is not reliable. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that can be used to analyze the data collected by sensors. Data mining is another type of technology that can be utilized in the healthcare industry. These techniques help predict heart disease based on various factors. We developed a prediction and recommendation model aimed at predicting heart disease using the Optimized Deep Belief Network. It does so by taking into account the various features of the heart disease UCI and Stalog database.

Trial discrepancies may be addressed by standardizing cell handling protocols, broadening clinical endpoints, and selecting patients likely to benefit from cell therapy. Machine learning can potentially assist with these tasks. Recent Findings: We introduce machine learning and review literature with the most efficacious results translatable to regenerative cardiology, such as in quality control systems during cell culturing, automated segmentation, and myocardial tissue characterization. Investigators are then cautioned on potential pitfalls and offered solutions to minimize model biasing. Summary: Standardizing imaging with automated segmentation can improve the quantification of left ventricular endpoints. Additionally, myocardial textural analysis has significant potential to uncover hidden biomarkers, which may address the need for novel clinical endpoints. Lastly, phenogrouping through radiomics signatures can assist in appropriating patients likely to respond to stem cell therapy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Convolutional neural networks--Deep neural networks--Fully convolutional neural networks--Machine learning--Radiomics--Regenerative medicine--U-Net;biological marker--artificial intelligence--artificial neural network--bright field microscopy--cardiac imaging--cardiovascular magnetic resonance--cell culture--clinical decision making--convolutional neural network--deep learning--deep neural network--echocardiography--heart catheterization--heart development--heart left ventricle ejection fraction--human--image quality--image reconstruction--image segmentation--induced pluripotent stem cell--learning algorithm--machine learning--nuclear magnetic resonance imaging--radiomics--regenerative medicine--Review--stem cell transplantation--texture analysis--tissue characterization--unsupervised machine learning;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85135822913

Pathological LVH can be caused by various diseases. In this study, we explored the possibility of using time and frequency domain analysis of myocardial radiomics features for patients with LVH in differentiating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), hypertensive heart disease (HHD) and uremic cardiomyopathy (UCM) based on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). This was the first study to explore TTE myocardial time and frequency domain analyses for multiple LVH etiology differentiation. Materials and methods: We proposed an artificially intelligent diagnosis system based on radiomics techniques for differentiating HCM, HHD and UCM on TTE videos of the apical four-chamber view, which mainly included interventricular septum (IVS) segmentation, feature extraction and classification. We used two independent cohorts, one with 150 patients, including 50 HHD, 50 HCM and 50 UCM, for segmentation training and testing, and another with 149 patients (namely the main cohort), including 50 HHD, 46 HCM and 53 UCM, for classification training and testing after segmentation and feature extraction. Firstly, the U-Net, Residual U-Net (ResUNet) and nnU-Net were trained and tested to segment the IVS on TTE still images in the first cohort. Then the trained model with the best segmentation performance was further used for IVS prediction of ordered TTE images in video sequences in the main cohort. The post-processing was used to eliminate the noisy debris by selecting the maximum connected region and smoothing the edges of the predicted IVS region. Secondly, static radiomics features were extracted from the IVS of ordered TTE images in each video sequence, and subsequently the time and frequency domain features were further extracted from each time series of a static radiomics feature in the video sequence. Finally, the point-wise gated Boltzmann machine (PGBM) was used to learn and fuse the time and frequency domain features, and the support vector machine was used to classify the learned features for LVH diagnosis. The classification was performed with five-fold cross validation. Results: The ResUNet showed the best segmentation performance, with Dice coefficient, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 0.817, 76.3%, 99.6% and 98.6%, respectively. With post-processing, the Dice coefficient, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the ResUNet were further improved to 0.839, 77.0%, 99.8%, and 98.8%, respectively. The classification areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were 0.838 ± 0.049 for HHD vs. HCM, 0.868 ± 0.042 for HCM vs. UCM and 0.701 ± 0.140 for HHD vs. UCM. Conclusion: In this work, we proposed an intelligent identification system for LVH etiology classification based on routine TTE video images with good diagnostic performance. This deep learning method is feasible in automatic TTE images interpretation and expected to assist clinicians in detecting the primary cause of LVH. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.;Artificially intelligent diagnosis--Deep learning--Interventricular septum (IVS) segmentation--Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)--Time and frequency domain analyses--Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE);Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic--Echocardiography--Heart Diseases--Humans--Hypertension--Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular--Myocardium--Cardiology--Computer aided diagnosis--Deep learning--Echocardiography--Extraction--Feature extraction--Frequency domain analysis--Image segmentation--Pathology--Support vector machines--Time series--Video recording--Artificially intelligent diagnose--Deep learning--Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy--Intelligent diagnosis--Interventricular septum  segmentation--Leave ventricular hypertrophy--Left ventricular hypertrophies--Time- and frequency-domain analysis--Transthoracic echocardiography--adult--Article--artificial intelligence--Boltzmann machine--cardiomyopathy--clinical feature--cohort analysis--cross validation--feature extraction--female--heart disease--heart left ventricle hypertrophy--human--hypertension--hypertrophic cardiomyopathy--interventricular septum--major clinical study--male--middle aged--radiomics--sensitivity and specificity--support vector machine--transthoracic echocardiography--uremia--videorecording--cardiac muscle--complication--diagnostic imaging--echocardiography--heart disease--heart left ventricle hypertrophy--hypertension--hypertrophic cardiomyopathy--Classification (of information);Elsevier Ireland Ltd;36257197;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85139868481

This fact is reflected by current guidelines, which show a fundamental shift towards non-invasive imaging - especially CCTA. The guidelines for acute and stable coronary artery disease (CAD) of the European Society of Cardiology from 2019 and 2020 emphasize this shift. However, to fulfill this new role, a broader availability in adjunct with increased robustness of data acquisition and speed of data reporting of CCTA is needed. Artificial intelligence (AI) has made enormous progress for all imaging methodologies concerning (semi)-automatic tools for data acquisition and data post-processing, with outreach toward decision support systems. Besides onco- and neuroimaging, cardiac imaging is one of the main areas of application. Most current AI developments in the scenario of cardiac imaging are related to data postprocessing. However, AI applications (including radiomics) for CCTA also should enclose data acquisition (especially the fact of dose reduction) and data interpretation (presence and extent of CAD). The main effort will be to integrate these AI-driven processes into the clinical workflow, and to combine imaging data/results with further clinical data, thus - beyond the diagnosis of CAD- enabling prediction and forecast of morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, data fusing for therapy planning (e.g., invasive angiography/TAVI planning) will be warranted. The aim of this review is to present a holistic overview of AI applications in CCTA (including radiomics) under the umbrella of clinical workflows and clinical decision-making. The review first summarizes and analyzes applications for the main role of CCTA, i.e., to non-invasively rule out stable coronary artery disease. In the second step, AI applications for additional diagnostic purposes, i.e., to improve diagnostic power (CAC = coronary artery classifications), improve differential diagnosis (CT-FFR and CT perfusion), and finally improve prognosis (again CAC plus epi- and pericardial fat analysis) are reviewed.

Aim: In this paper, novel classification algorithms that transfer heart sound classification into image classification are proposed to select better features. The features used were all important in clinical diagnosis. Method: First, four open datasets are used to construct an integrated dataset. Second, the data is preprocessed. Third, two-dimensional features are extracted. In the end, different methods like traditional machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning are applied to classify heart sounds. Results: The results show that logmel and logpower can achieve a better effect than envelope and waveform, and the average accuracy is improved by 6–10%, which can achieve around 94%. F1 score shows a trend consistent with accuracy. This is verified by both machine learning and deep learning methods. Under the experimental conditions in this paper, transfer learning can promote the effect of Xception and MobileNet, the accuracy can improve by about 2% on time-domain features. The results of transfer learning are comparatively more stable, and more results are within the 95% confidence interval. Conclusion: This paper uses different methods to systematically compare the effects of different two-dimensional features in heart sound classification, and explains why different features achieve different effects from different perspectives such as clinical, and provides new insights like the application of feature fusion in it. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd;Deep learning--Heart sound classification--Image classification--Transfer learning;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Computer aided diagnosis--Deep learning--Image classification--Learning systems--Time domain analysis--Cardiovascular disease--Deep learning--Diagnosis methods--Heart sound classification--Heart sounds--Images classification--Machine-learning--Sound classification--Transfer learning--Two-dimensional features--Article--Bayesian learning--classification algorithm--controlled study--data accuracy--data processing--deep learning--feature extraction--heart sound--human--image analysis--k nearest neighbor--support vector machine--transfer of learning--waveform--Heart;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85138468155

They will not experience sickness often until they reach the last stage of heart disease, and so the damages are not reversible. Thus, the solution for reducing the death rate of heart disease healthcare is becoming the passive medical care type. Physicians usually monitor the physical status of patients, which helps in deciding when to provide medical services by considering the real-time analysis of patients. Moreover, a significant division of pervasive clinical care is taken as the development of practical monitoring systems. An IoT approaches are overwhelming the progression in addressing the issue of heart disease patient care since they can modify the service mode in a pervasive way. A remote monitoring model is more significant for realising pervasive healthcare services. Here, an ‘optimised ensemble learning’-based IoT-enabled heart disease monitoring system through an optimised ensemble fuzzy ranking (OEFR) strategy, deep feature extraction and heuristic improvement. Moreover, the hyperparameter of each classifier is optimised through a new improved dingo optimiser (I-DOX) algorithm. Throughout the result analysis, the accuracy of the designed I-DOX-based OEFR model is attained 96.72%.

Prior false-alarm reduction approaches are often rule-based and require hand-crafted features from physiological waveforms as inputs to machine learning classifiers. Despite considerable prior efforts to address the problem, false alarms are a continuing problem in the ICUs. In this work, we present a deep learning framework to automatically learn feature representations of physiological waveforms using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to discriminate between true vs. false arrhythmia alarms. We use Contrastive Learning to simultaneously minimize a binary cross entropy classification loss and a proposed similarity loss from pair-wise comparisons of waveform segments over time as a discriminative constraint. Furthermore, we augment our deep models with learned embeddings from a rule-based method to leverage prior domain knowledge for each alarm type. We evaluate our method using the dataset from the 2015 PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge. Ablation analysis demonstrates that Contrastive Learning significantly improves the performance of a combined deep learning and rule-based-embedding approach. Our results indicate that the final proposed deep learning framework achieves superior performance in comparison to the winning entries of the Challenge. © 2022, The Author(s).;;Arrhythmias, Cardiac--Clinical Alarms--Electrocardiography--False Positive Reactions--Humans--Intensive Care Units--Monitoring, Physiologic--alarm monitor--electrocardiography--false positive result--heart arrhythmia--human--intensive care unit--physiologic monitoring--procedures;Nature Research;35304473;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85126657327

This study provides an analytical technique for predicting the prognosis of patients with severe acute myocardial infarction using a support vector machine (SVM) technique based on information gleaned from electronic medical records in the Medical Information Marketplace for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database. The MIMIC-III database provided 4785 electronic medical records data for inclusion in the model development after screening 7070 electronic medical records of patients admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment of acute myocardial infarction. Adopting the APS-III score as the criterion for identifying anticipated risk, the dimensions of data information incorporated into the mathematical model design were found using correlation coefficient matrix heatmaps and ordered logistic analysis. An automated prognostic risk-prediction model was developed using SVM, and the fit was evaluated by 5× cross-validation. We used a grid search method to further optimize the parameters and improve the model fit. The excellent generalization ability of SVM was fully verified by calculating the 95% confidence interval of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for six algorithms (linear discriminant, tree, Kernel Naive Bayes, RUSBoost, KNN, and SVM). Compared to the remaining five models, its confidence interval was the narrowest with higher fitting accuracy and better performance. The patient prognostic risk prediction model constructed using SVM had a relatively impressive accuracy (92.2%) and AUC value (0.98). In this study, a model was designed for fitting that can maximize the potential information to be gleaned in the electronic medical records data. It was demonstrated that SVM models based on electronic medical records data can offer an effective solution for clinical disease prognostic risk assessment and improved clinical outcomes and have great potential for clinical application in the clinical treatment of myocardial infarction.

The classification of heart condition by utilising the CAD on echocardiogram is an essential and primary step, which should be performed in a precise manner. This process aims to achieve a strong differentiation among abnormal and normal heart conditions through machine learning algorithms. As the heart disease diagnosis using echocardiography is still a complex process, it can be adopted with different deep learning approaches for identification. For solving these issues, this paper develops a novel heart disease diagnosis using echocardiogram images and video frames. As speckle noise is the main problem in echocardiogram images, noise reduction is the initial phase of the process. This is performed by the adaptive speckle-noise reduction technique. Then, the hybrid pattern extraction is adopted using two well-performing techniques termed local binary pattern and local directional texture pattern. This extracted hybrid pattern is subjected to the optimised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Here, optimised CNN is accomplished by the distance-based cat swarm optimisation for enhancing the diagnosis accuracy of heart disease. Finally, the proposed work shows the efficiency of the developed echocardiogram-based CAD heart disease diagnosis system by conducting the experiments. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;adaptive speckle noise reduction--distance-based cat swarm optimisation--Echocardiography--heart disease diagnosis--hybrid pattern extraction--optimised convolutional neural network;Cardiology--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Diseases--Extraction--Heart--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Local binary pattern--Speckle--Textures--Adaptive speckle noise reduction--Convolutional neural network--Distance-based--Distance-based cat swarm optimization--Heart disease diagnosis--Hybrid pattern extraction--Hybrid patterns--Optimized convolutional neural network--Pattern extraction--Speckle noise reduction--Swarm optimization--Article--artificial intelligence--cardiac imaging--controlled study--convolutional neural network--deep learning--diagnostic procedure--diagnostic test accuracy study--echocardiography--heart disease--human--image segmentation--learning algorithm--machine learning--sensitivity and specificity--speckle tracking echocardiography--Echocardiography;Taylor and Francis Ltd.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85125371746

Coronary stenosis is a narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by plaque that reduces the blood flow to the heart. Automatic classification of coronary stenosis images has been re-cently addressed using deep and machine learning techniques. Generally, the machine learning methods form a bank of empirical and automatic features from the angiographic images. In the present work, a novel method for the automatic classification of coronary stenosis X-ray images is presented. The method is based on convolutional neural networks, where the neural architecture search is performed by using the path-based metaheuristics of simulated annealing. To perform the neural architecture search, the maximization of the F1-score metric is used as the fitness function. The automatically generated convolutional neural network was compared with three deep learning methods in terms of the accuracy and F1-score metrics using a testing set of images obtaining 0.88 and 0.89, respectively. In addition, the proposed method was evaluated with different sets of coronary stenosis images obtained via data augmentation.

This research concentrates on modelling and automated disease prediction model to offer an earlier prediction model for heart disease and the risk factors. This work considers a standard UCI machine learning-based benchmark dataset for model validation and extracts the risk factors related to the disease. The outliers and imbalanced datasets are pre-processed using data normalization to enhance the classification performance. Here, feature selection is performed using non-linear Particle Swarm Optimization (NL - PSO). Finally, classification is done with the Improved Deep Evolutionary model with Feed Forward Neural Networks (IDEBDFN). The algorithm's learning nature is used to evaluate the nature of the hidden layers to produce the optimal results. The outcomes demonstrate that the anticipated model provides superior prediction accuracy. The simulation is carried out in a MATLAB environment, and metrics like accuracy, F-measure, precision, recall, and so on are evaluated. The accuracy (without features) of the evolutionary model in the UCI ML dataset is 97.65%, accuracy (with features) is 98.56%, specificity is 95%, specificity is 2% higher than both the datasets, F1-score is 40%, execution time (min) is 0.04 min, and the AUROC is 96.85% which is substantially higher than other datasets.

Most of the current myocardial infarction region segmentation methods are based on fully supervised deep learning. However, cardiologists' annotation of myocardial infarction regions in cardiac magnetic resonance images during the diagnosis process is time-consuming and expensive. This paper proposes a semi-supervised myocardial infarction segmentation. It consists of two models: 1) a boundary mining model and 2) an adversarial learning model. The boundary mining model can solve the boundary ambiguity problem by enlarging the gap between the foreground and background features, thus segmenting the myocardial infarction region accurately. The adversarial learning model can make the boundary mining model learn from additional unlabeled data by evaluating the segmentation performance and providing pseudo supervision, which significantly increases the robustness of the boundary mining model. We conduct extensive experiments on an in-house myocardial magnetic resonance dataset.

However, its acquisition is affected by inter-observer variability and largely dependent on the operator’s experience. In this context, artificial intelligence techniques could reduce these variabilities and provide a user independent system. In recent years, machine learning (ML) algorithms have been used in echocardiography to automate echocardiographic acquisition. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art studies that use ML to automate tasks regarding the acquisition of echocardiograms, including quality assessment (QA), recognition of cardiac views and assisted probe guidance during the scanning process. The results indicate that performance of automated acquisition was overall good, but most studies lack variability in their datasets. From our comprehensive review, we believe automated acquisition has the potential not only to improve accuracy of diagnosis, but also help novice operators build expertise and facilitate point of care healthcare in medically underserved areas.

To this end, several conventional machine learning models have gained popularity in providing precise prediction of heart diseases by taking into account the underlying conditions of patients. The drawbacks associated with these methods are a lack of generalization and the convergence rate of these methods being much slower. As the healthcare data associated with these systems scale up leading to healthcare big data issues, a Cloud-Fog computing-based paradigm is necessary to facilitate low-latency and energy-efficient computation of the healthcare data. In this paper, a DeepMist framework is suggested which exploits Deep Learning models operating over Mist Computing infrastructure to leverage fast predictive convergence, low-latency, and energy efficiency for smart healthcare systems. We exploit the Deep Q Network (DQN) algorithm for building the prediction model for identifying heart diseases over the Mist computing layer. Different performance evaluation metrics, like precision, recall, f-measure, accuracy, energy consumption, and delay, are used to assess the proposed DeepMist framework. It provided an overall prediction accuracy of 97.6714% and loss value of 0.3841, along with energy consumption and delay of 32.1002 mJ and 2.8002 ms respectively. To validate the efficacy of DeepMist, we compare its outcomes over the heart disease dataset in convergence with other benchmark models like Q-Reinforcement Learning (QRL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms and observe that the proposed scheme outperforms all others.  © 2013 IEEE.;Deep learning--energy efficiency--heart disease prediction--latency--mist computing--performance evaluation;Big data--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Edge computing--Fog computing--Forecasting--Health care--Reinforcement learning--Cloud-computing--Computational modelling--Deep learning--Edge computing--Heart disease--Heart disease prediction--Latency--Medical services--Mist computing--Performances evaluation--Energy efficiency;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85153355088

It's a serious issue for the humans as it requires proper diagnosis. Coronary artery disease develops over time as a result of plaque build- up in coronary arteries results in partial blockage of blood flow as the, which is primarily composed of cholesterol, calcium, and fibrin. Coronary arteries help human heart to pump oxygen-rich blood throughout the body by supplying it. However, appropriate diagnosis and early prediction will lessen the likelihood of developing it. This study explores the possibility of foreseeing cardiac illness at an early stage using deep learning algorithms. This study's primary goal is to properly determine whether a person has heart problems or not. by using deep learning techniques, Deep learning and various machine learning algorithms can both be used to implement early-stage prediction.

Currently, heart sound classification attracts many researchers from the fields of telemedicine, digital signal processing, and machine learning—among others—mainly to identify cardiac pathology as quickly as possible. This article proposes chaogram as a new transform to convert heart sound signals to colour images. In the proposed approach, the output image is, therefore, the projection of the reconstructed phase space representation of the phonocardiogram (PCG) signal on three coordinate planes. This has two major benefits: (1) it makes possible to apply deep convolutional neural networks to heart sounds and (2) it is also possible to employ a transfer learning scheme by converting a heart sound signal to an image. The performance of the proposed approach was verified on the PhysioNet dataset. Due to the imbalanced data on this dataset, it is common to assess the results quality using the average of sensitivity and specificity, which is known as score, instead of accuracy. In this study, the best results were achieved using the (Formula presented.) model, which achieved a score of 88.06%. © 2022 by the authors.;biomedical signal--deep learning--phonocardiogram--signal to image transform;Heart Diseases--Heart Sounds--Humans--Machine Learning--Neural Networks, Computer--Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted--Biomedical signal processing--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep neural networks--Digital signal processing--Heart--Image classification--Phase space methods--Phonocardiography--Telemedicine--Biomedical signal--Classification of heart sounds--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Heart sound signal--Heart sounds--Image transforms--Phonocardiograms--Signal to image transform--Transfer learning--heart disease--heart sound--human--machine learning--signal processing--Cardiology;MDPI;36559937;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85144496602

We developed machine learning (ML) algorithms and investigated their performance in predicting patients’ current CVD risk (coronary heart disease and stroke in this study). Materials and methods: We compared traditional logistic regression (LR) with five ML algorithms LR with Elastic-Net, Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), Support Vector Machine, Deep Learning, and an Ensemble model averaging predictions from RF, XGB, and Deep Learning for CVD risk prediction using pre-existing patient-level data from a multi-center, cross-sectional study (the Microalbuminuria Screening in Hypertensive Patients Project initiated by the China International Exchange and Promotive Association for Medical and Healthcare) that enrolled 143,043 patients with hypertension from 600 tertiary, secondary, or community hospitals. Each of the five ML algorithms incorporated 18 variables, such as demographics, examinations, comorbidities, and treatment regimens, and were trained and evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. Predictive accuracy was assessed by the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC). Results: Patients’ mean age was 62 ± 12 years and 57% were men. Advanced ML algorithms outperformed the traditional LR model. Particularly, the Ensemble model had superior discrimination with an AUROC of 0.760 than LR (AUC = 0.737) and other tested models. Conclusion: We establishes an Ensemble model that shows better performance in predicting patients’ current CVD risk using routine information compared to the traditional LR model. ML can help physicians design follow-up plans with more accurate results, offering new possibilities for short-term risk prediction and early detection. Further, ML models can be trained with longitudinal data and used to predict long-term CVD risks, thereby informing CVD prevention.

In order to prevent patients from other damages, precise diagnostics of CVD on time is a crucial factor. Researcher workers are inspired to apply machine learning (ML) for accurate and quick diagnosis of CVD. ML algorithm extracts patterns and hidden relationships in the medical dataset for detecting or predicting disease development. But the prediction of CVD is a challenging task. The increasing size of healthcare dataset has made it a complex task for practitioners to make disease predictions and understand the feature relations. And so, selection of crucial features in a dataset plays a key role in optimizing the performance of ML algorithm. This study develops an Automated Cardiovascular Disease Diagnosis using Honey Badger Optimization with Modified Deep Learning (ACVD-HBOMDL) Model. The major aim of the ACVD-HBOMDL technique lies in the classification of CVD using feature selection (FS) and hyperparameter tuning strategies. Initially, the ACVD-HBOMDL technique applies min-max scaler to preprocess the medical data. To elect an optimal subset of features, the HBO algorithm is used in this work. For CVD classification, deep learning modified neural network (DLMNN) classifier is used and its hyperparameters can be optimally chosen by Bayesian optimization. The experimental results of the ACVD-HBOMDL technique can be tested on benchmark medical dataset and the obtained results demonstrate the significant outcomes of the ACVD-HBOMDL technique over other existing techniques.  © 2013 IEEE.;Cardiovascular disease--computer aided diagnosis--deep learning--feature selection--honey badger algorithm--parameter tuning;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Computer aided diagnosis--Deep learning--Diseases--Feature Selection--Food products--Forecasting--Learning systems--Medical imaging--Cardiovascular disease--Clinical diagnosis--Deep learning--Features extraction--Features selection--Honey badger algorithm--Medical diagnostic imaging--Parameters tuning--Predictive models--Computer aided instruction;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85162615396

C. Roy Post Graduate Institute of Paediatric Sciences, Kolkata, 700054, India;The objective of this study is to develop an automated clinically relevant diagnostic framework for a group of cardiovascular diseases, namely, valvular heart diseases (VHDs). Though for clinical screening, manual auscultation using a stethoscope is the current standard, it is losing its significance due to the demand for years of skill and experience from the clinician. While the physiological location for capturing heart sound signal, called phonocardiogram (PCG), is standardized, the measurement and classification of PCG into different VHDs need automation to redeem its importance. Recent research on the applicability of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) in PCG-based classification of VHDs produced high accuracy, but often loses the clinical explanation behind them, and hence, often not endorsed by the healthcare fraternity. The proposed study attempts to bridge this gap with two types of clinically explainable automated frameworks: 1) one utilizes clinically relevant PCG features in statistical rule-based models (RBM) as well as ML-based decision-tree (DT) frameworks--2) the other uses time-frequency representation (TFR) with 2-D convolution neural network (CNN) and signal of PCG cycle with 1-D CNN, reveals similar clinically explainable intelligence. As a case study, mitral valve prolapse (MVP) - a specific VHD categorized into three severity subclasses of early systolic click (ESC), ESC with murmur (ESCM), and mid-SC with murmur (MSCM). The signature events (S1, S2, SC, and murmur) in PCG are segmented using a novel Teager-Kaiser energy operator and continuous wavelet transform (TKEO-CWT) algorithm. Clinically relevant intra- and inter-event features like duration, intensity, and pitch (dominant frequency) in RBM and DT produced 100% and 98.6% accuracies, respectively. Interestingly, gradient class activation (Grad-CAM) of 1-D and 2-D CNN with PCG signal and scalogram as input also converges to the same clinical explanations. Thus, the proposed clinically explainable frameworks demonstrate excellent potential in measurements and classifications in future clinical diagnostic products. © 1963-2012 IEEE.;Click-murmur--explainable classifiers--heart sound events--systolic click (SC);Automation--Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Clinical research--Decision trees--Deep learning--Echocardiography--Heart--Phonocardiography--Wavelet transforms--Click-murmur--Continuous Wavelet Transform--Explainable classifier--Heart sound event--Heart sounds--Heart valves--Phonocardiograms--Sound events--Systolic click--Time-frequency Analysis--Diseases;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85148452153

There is significant interest in using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyse data from novel sensors such as wearables to provide an earlier and more accurate prediction and diagnosis of heart disease. Digital health technologies that fuse AI and sensing devices may help disease prevention and reduce the substantial morbidity and mortality caused by CVD worldwide. In this review, we identify and describe recent developments in the application of digital health for CVD, focusing on AI approaches for CVD detection, diagnosis, and prediction through AI models driven by data collected from wearables. We summarise the literature on the use of wearables and AI in cardiovascular disease diagnosis, followed by a detailed description of the dominant AI approaches applied for modelling and prediction using data acquired from sensors such as wearables. We discuss the AI algorithms and models and clinical applications and find that AI and machine-learning-based approaches are superior to traditional or conventional statistical methods for predicting cardiovascular events. However, further studies evaluating the applicability of such algorithms in the real world are needed.

In this article, the heart rate variability (HRV) parameters are used for predicting cardiac arrest in smokers based on the deep learning techniques. First, the input data is collected from MITU Skillogies dataset, which consists of 1562 smoker and non-smoker instances with 19 HRV input attributes/features. After data collection, the enhanced Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (EABC) is developed for feature selection. The EABC algorithm includes two new multi-objective functions for decreasing the number of attributes in the MITU Skillogies dataset. This mechanism superiorly reduces the burden of computational complexity and improves classification accuracy. Further, the selected attributes are given to the stacked autoencoder classifier for non-cardiac arrest and cardiac arrest classification in smokers for early diagnosis. The extensive experiment showed that the EABC with stacked autoencoder model obtained 96.26% of classification accuracy, which is better related to the traditional machine learning models. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;Artificial Bee Colony algorithm--cardiac arrest prediction--heart rate variability--machine learning--stacked autoencoder model;Algorithms--Heart--Heart Rate--Machine Learning--Artificial heart--Cardiology--Deep learning--Heart--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Optimization--Smoke--Artificial bee colony algorithm--Artificial bees--Auto encoders--Bee colony algorithms--Cardiac arrest--Cardiac arrest prediction--Classification accuracy--Heart rate variability--Machine-learning--Stacked autoencoder model--adult--algorithm--Article--artificial bee colony algorithm--cardiovascular disease--classification algorithm--classifier--coronary artery disease--decision tree--deep learning--diastolic blood pressure--entropy--heart arrest--heart rate--heart rate variability--human--machine learning--major clinical study--prediction--random forest--sensitivity and specificity--smoking--stacked autoencoder--support vector machine--systolic blood pressure--thorax pain--algorithm--heart--machine learning--physiology--Forecasting;Taylor and Francis Ltd.;37067988;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85152928932

Follow-up measure with drugs and hospitalization can affect the survival of heart failure patients. Currently, none of the heart failure survival models including theses variables are effective yet. In this paper, we propose a method to effectively predict deaths within a year in patients with heart failure in Korea through preprocessing and deep learning. We used Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry dataset which considers various features of patients with a left ventricular ejection rate 40% or less. Feature importance was measured using four models to find key features related to patients' survival. We conducted several data preprocessing such as missing value imputation. Our machine learning approach showed higher accuracy than existing methods for predicting one year mortality of patients in heart failure. © 2023 IEEE.;death--deep learning--feature selection--heart failure--KAMIR--machine learning--missing value;Cardiology--Deep learning--Deterioration--Feature Selection--Forecasting--Learning systems--Death--Deep learning--Features selection--Follow up--Heart failure--KAMIR--Machine-learning--Missing value imputation--Missing values--Survival model--Heart;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85151545152

Many AI tools have been shown to be efficacious with a high level of accuracy. Yet, their use in real life is not well established. In the era of health technology and data science, it is crucial to consider how these tools could improve healthcare delivery. This is particularly important in countries with limited resources, such as low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). LMICs have many barriers in the care continuum of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and big portion of these barriers come from scarcity of resources, mainly financial and human power constraints. AI/ML could potentially improve healthcare delivery if appropriately applied in these countries. Expectedly, the current literature lacks original articles about AI/ML originating from these countries. It is important to start early with a stepwise approach to understand the obstacles these countries face in order to develop AI/ML-based solutions. This could be detrimental to many patients’ lives, in addition to other expected advantages in other sectors, including the economy sector. In this report, we aim to review what is known about AI/ML in cardiovascular medicine, and to discuss how it could benefit LMICs. © 2023 Alabdaljabar et al.;Artificial intelligence--Cardiology--Countries--Income--Low--Machine learning--Middle;acute kidney failure--area under the curve--artificial intelligence--cardiology--cardiovascular disease--cerebrovascular accident--CHA2DS2-VASc score--chronic kidney failure--conceptual framework--controlled study--coronavirus disease 2019--deep learning--deep neural network--dementia--diagnostic test accuracy study--economic aspect--epilepsy--health care delivery--heart failure--heart left ventricle ejection fraction--human--kidney transplantation--learning algorithm--low income country--machine learning--middle income country--premature labor--randomized controlled trial (topic)--receiver operating characteristic--renal replacement therapy--Review--skin disease--thorax radiography--ulcer;Dove Medical Press Ltd;;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85148716918

In ECG DL, researchers often use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and traditionally use the full duration of raw ECG waveforms that create redundancies in feature learning and result in inaccurate predictions with large uncertainties. Objective: For enhancing these predictions, we introduced a sub-waveform representation that leverages the rhythmic pattern of ECG waveforms (data-centric approach) rather than changing the CNN architecture (model-centric approach). Results: We applied the proposed representation to a population with 92,446 patients to identify left ventricular dysfunction. We found that the sub-waveform representation increases the performance metrics compared to the full-waveform representation. We observed a 2% increase for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and 10% increase for area under the precision-recall curve. We also carefully examined three reliability components of explainability, interpretability, and fairness. We provided an explanation for enhancements obtained by heartbeat alignment mechanism. By developing a new scoring system, we interpreted the clinical relevance of ECG features and showed that sub-waveform representation further pushes the scores towards clinical predictions. Finally, we showed that the new representation significantly reduces prediction uncertainties within subgroups that contributes to individual fairness. Conclusion: We expect that this added control over the granularity of ECG data will improve the DL modeling for new artificial intelligence technologies in the cardiovascular space. © 2022 Heart Rhythm Society;Deep learning, Cardiology, Electrocardiograms, Sub-waveform representation, Machine Learning;adult--Article--artificial intelligence--cardiology--controlled study--convolutional neural network--deep learning--diagnostic test accuracy study--electrocardiogram--female--heart beat--heart left ventricle failure--human--machine learning--major clinical study--male--model--prediction--receiver operating characteristic--reliability--scoring system--uncertainty--waveform;Elsevier Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85139361754

R. Ambedkar NIT Jalandhar, Jalandhar, India;Heart disease is one among the critical human diseases as well as healthcare issue, that affects human very severely. It occurs when heart is unable to supply appropriate amount of blood to the parts of body. It is the most fatal issue which cannot be seen with naked eye. At the exact time, it requires accurate diagnosis. For preventing heart failure, it is significant to give treatment to the heart disease accurately on time. In many aspects, diagnosing the heart disease is a traditional one which is not reliable. Machine learning and deep learning methods are significant as it is used to find persons ailing from heart disease. Nowadays, research on heart disease prediction is increasing which completely summarizes the research on it.

The only way to reduce these deaths is to diagnose them at the earliest. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of ensemble learning methods in creating the model for effective and improved diagnosis of Heart disease (HD). In this paper, we propose a multi-tier ensemble (MTE) model with Random Forest feature selection for effective and improved diagnosis of HD. The tiers consist of different combinations of ML and ensemble learning techniques. The model is then validated using a dataset that is curated using five widely known heart disease datasets, Cleveland and Statlog datasets to confirm the efficacy of the proposed methodology. The experimental results are evaluated in several performance measures i.e., accuracy, precision, recall and f-measure and area under curve (AUC). The results reveals that the proposed ensemble model outperformed with accuracy 93.76% as compared to the other classification models for the curated dataset. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is also used to examine the significance of the model. The proposed model also performed significantly better than previous studies and state-of-art methods, implying that it can play an important role in medical decision-making for HD diagnosis. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.;Artificial intelligence--Diagnosis--Ensemble learning--Heart disease--Machine learning;Artificial heart--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Decision trees--Diseases--Heart--Learning systems--Machine learning--Cleveland--Ensemble learning--Ensemble models--Features selection--Heart disease--Learning methods--Learning techniques--Machine-learning--Multi-tier--Random forests--algorithm--Article--cardiovascular disease--controlled study--convolutional neural network--deep learning--diagnostic test accuracy study--heart disease--human--k nearest neighbor--learning algorithm--logistic regression analysis--machine learning--model--morbidity--mortality--multi tier ensemble model--random forest--support vector machine--Wilcoxon signed ranks test--Diagnosis;Springer;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85139843950

On the other hand, DE-MRI instructions for segmenting and classifying cardiac hypertrophy are complex and prone to inaccuracy. Developing cardiac DE-MRI classification and prediction methods is crucial. Methods: This paper introduces a self-supervised myocardial histology segmentation algorithm with multi-scale portrayal consistency to address the degree of sophistication of cardiology DE-MRI. The model retrieves multi-scale representations from multiple expanded viewpoints using a Siamese system and uses resemblance learning instruction to achieve unlabeled representations. The DE-MRI data train the network weights to generate a superior segmentation effect by accurately reflecting the exact scale information. The paper provides an end-to-end method for detecting myocardial fibrosis tissue using a Transformer as a result of the poor classification outcomes of myocardial fibrosis substance in DE-MRI. A deep learning model is created using the Pre-LN Transformer decoded simultaneously with the Multi-Scale Transformer backbone structure developed in this paper. In addition, the joint regression cost, which incorporates the CIoU Loss and the L1 Loss, is used to determine the distance between forecast blocks and labels. Results: Increasing the independent evaluation and annotations position compared enhances performance compared to the segmentation method without canvas matching by 1.76%, 1.27%, 0.93%, and -1.17 mm on Dice, PPV, SEN, and HD, respectively. Based on the strongest of the three single-scale representation methodologies, the segmentation model in this study is enhanced by 0.71%, 0.79%, and 1.47%, as well as -1.49 mm on Dice, PPV, SEN, and HD, respectively. The effectiveness and reliability of the segmentation model are confirmed. Additionally, testing results show that this study's recognition system's mAP is 84.97%, which is greater than the benchmark techniques used in most other studies. The framework converges round is compressed by 18.1% compared to the DETR detection approach, and the identification rate is improved by 3.5%, proving the strategy's value. Conclusion: The self-supervised cardiac fibrosis segmentation method with multi-scale portrayal consistency and end-to-end myocardial histology categorization is introduced in this study. To solve the challenges of segmentation and myocardial fibrosis identification in cardiology DE-MRI, a Transformer-based detection approach is put forth. It may address the issue of the myocardial scarring material's low accuracy in segmentation and classification in DE-MRI, as well as provide clinicians with a fibrosis diagnosis that is supplementary to the conventional therapy of heart ailments. © 2022;DE-MRI--Image segmentation--Myocardial fibrosis--Self-supervision--Transformer;Algorithms--Fibrosis--Humans--Image Processing, Computer-Assisted--Magnetic Resonance Imaging--Reproducibility of Results--Deep learning--Histology--Image classification--Image enhancement--Learning systems--Magnetic resonance imaging--Tissue--DE-MRI--Detection approach--End to end--Images segmentations--Multi-scales--Myocardial fibrosis--Segmentation methods--Segmentation models--Self-supervision--Transformer--Article--classification algorithm--comparative study--cross validation--deep learning--disease classification--feature extraction--feature learning (machine learning)--heart muscle fibrosis--human--image segmentation--nuclear magnetic resonance imaging--predictive value--reliability--residual neural network--segmentation algorithm--algorithm--fibrosis--image processing--procedures--reproducibility--Image segmentation;Elsevier Ireland Ltd;36274507;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85140306523

Every year, millions of people die of cardiovascular diseases. However, one can decrease the mortality rates if the heart disease was detected and treated early. Usually, people do an electrocardiogram (ECG) test to know about the well-being of their heart. Some kind of irregular functioning and illness in the heart can be found in an ECG test. When the heart malfunctions or if there is any improper beating of the heart, then it results in arrhythmia. There are several types of arrhythmia and some of them are fatal. The process to identify the correct type of arrhythmia is quite difficult and effort-taking process. Even the small changes in the ECG relate to another kind of arrhythmia. It takes experience and patience to recognize the type of arrhythmia accurately. Therefore, deep learning techniques should be employed to analyze the test. Machine learning that involves many levels of processing is known as deep learning. From computer vision to natural language processing, there’s a lot to learn. It has been used in various applications. This method is receiving more popularity because of extreme accuracy, provided the numerous amount of data. The interesting feature is that it analyses the examples and distinguishes the classes and levels automatically. This study is regarding arrhythmia prediction in ECG and the attention it deserves in deep learning community. Providing CNN model, we are going to elaborate the process of detecting cardiac arrhythmia using ECG dataset in this study. The model is executed by rendering CNN with cardiac arrhythmia recognition database. Purpose: About one-third of the world’s population is affected by arrhythmia. Hence, the development of new and successful methodologies is highly in demand in the field of arrhythmia prediction. Further, the need of a cost-effective wearable monitoring gadget to identify the condition of arrhythmia is highly recommended. It assures the trouble-free environment for those who are affected. Observations: Various research papers that were written bases on arrhythmia prediction using machine learning techniques. Additionally, there are also new advancements all over Internet regarding deep learning-based strategies. These strategies can bring an immense change in cardiac arrhythmia prediction. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;Arrhythmia detection--Arrhythmia prediction--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Electrocardiography--VGG 16--Visual geometry group-19;Cardiology--Convolutional neural networks--Cost effectiveness--Deep learning--Diseases--Forecasting--Heart--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Natural language processing systems--Arrhythmia detection--Arrhythmia prediction--Cardiac arrhythmia--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Fatal disease--Heart disease--Learning techniques--VGG 16--Visual geometry group-19--Electrocardiograms;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85151148460

Up to now, AI has been applied to various aspects of medicine, including disease diagnosis, surveillance, treatment, predicting future risk, targeted interventions and understanding of the disease. There have been plenty of successful examples in medicine of using big data, such as radiology and pathology, ophthalmology cardiology and surgery. Combining medicine and AI has become a powerful tool to change health care, and even to change the nature of disease screening in clinical diagnosis. As all we know, clinical laboratories produce large amounts of testing data every day and the clinical laboratory data combined with AI may establish a new diagnosis and treatment has attracted wide attention. At present, a new concept of radiomics has been created for imaging data combined with AI, but a new definition of clinical laboratory data combined with AI has lacked so that many studies in this field cannot be accurately classified. Therefore, we propose a new concept of clinical laboratory omics (Clinlabomics) by combining clinical laboratory medicine and AI. Clinlabomics can use high-throughput methods to extract large amounts of feature data from blood, body fluids, secretions, excreta, and cast clinical laboratory test data.

Sudden heart attacks are often difficult to treat, so it is important to detect and prevent heart disease early. Most of the previous heart disease prediction methods are based on statistical machine learning algorithms, which can achieve good results but can only learn some superficial representations due to their own features, and cannot capture deep relationships, so to solve this problem we use deep neural networks for heart disease prediction. Further, current neural network methods often have difficulty learning discriminative features related to heart disease prediction. Therefore, to solve this problem, we leverage the center loss to enable the neural network to learn discriminative features and separate samples from different categories. We conducted experiments on one dataset, and the experimental results show that our method can effectively improve heart disease prediction while learning more discriminative features. © 2023 SPIE.;Deep learning--discriminative learning--heart disease--machine learning;Cardiology--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Health risks--Heart--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Deep learning--Discriminative features--Discriminative learning--Heart attack--Heart disease--Human health--Learn+--Machine-learning--Prediction methods--Statistical machine learning--Forecasting;SPIE;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85163309635

Calcification detection is considered an important factor in cardiovascular diseases. Currently, medical practitioners visually inspect the presence of calcification using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) images. The study aims to detect the extent of calcification as belonging to class I, II as mild calcification, and class III, IV as dense calcification from IVUS images acquired at 40 MHz. To detect calcification, the features were extracted using improved AlexNet architecture and then were fed into machine learning classifiers. The experiments were carried out using 14 real IVUS pullbacks of 10 patients. Experimental results show that the combination of traditional machine learning with deep learning approaches significantly improves accuracy. The results show that support vector machines outperform all other classifiers. The proposed model is compared with two other pre-trained models GoogLeNet (98.8%), SqueezeNet (99.2%), and exhibits considerable improvement in classification accuracy (99.8%). In the future other models such as Vision Transformers could be explored with additional feature selection methods such as ReliefF, PSO, ACO, etc. to improve the overall accuracy of diagnosis. © The Author(s) 2023.;convolutional neural network--coronary artery calcification--intravascular ultrasound--pre-trained networks--support vector machine;Calcinosis--Humans--Machine Learning--Ultrasonography--Ultrasonography, Interventional--Biomineralization--Bone--Calcification (biochemistry)--Cardiology--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Feature Selection--Learning systems--Medical imaging--Ultrasonic applications--Calcification detections--Cardiovascular disease--Convolutional neural network--Coronary artery calcification--Intravascular ultrasound--Intravascular ultrasound images--Machine-learning--Pre-trained network--Support vectors machine--Transfer learning--calcinosis--echography--human--interventional ultrasonography--machine learning--procedures--Support vector machines;SAGE Publications Inc.;37052393;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85153049750

Heart disease is linked to a variety of dangers, making it urgently necessary to find precise, reliable, and reasonable ways to make an early diagnosis and start treating the condition. Early diagnosis of cardiovascular illnesses can assist high-risk individuals in deciding on lifestyle changes that will minimise issues, which can be a big medical advancement. Since it takes more intelligence, time and expertise to provide 24-h medical consultations for patients, it is not always possible to accurately monitor patients every day. While an incorrect diagnosis of CVD can be catastrophic, an accurate diagnosis can lower the chance of major health issues. In order to compare the findings and analysis, various machine learning methods and deep learning are used. Data analysis is a frequently used technique for analysing enormous amounts of data in the healthcare industry. In order to help healthcare professionals forecast heart illness, researchers analyse enormous volumes of complex health records utilising various statistical and machine learning (ML) techniques. The main objective is to identify an appropriate method for heart disease prediction that is effective and precise. In this chapter, we conducted research on heart disease from the perspective of data analytics. To identify and anticipate the patterns of diseases, we applied different data analytical techniques on data sets of various sizes. We determined which algorithms were the most pertinent and also examined the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision rate of various algorithms. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Artificial intelligence--Cardiovascular medicine--Machine learning--Support Vector Machine;Cardiology--Data Analytics--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Health care--Heart--Learning systems--Cardiovascular disease--Cardiovascular medicine--Causes of death--Condition--Early diagnosis--Heart disease--High-risk individuals--Machine learning techniques--Machine-learning--Support vectors machine--Support vector machines;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85151130014

Arteries in the heart generate oxygenated blood to all body parts, however sometimes blood vessels become clogged or restrained due to cardiac issues. Past heart diagnosis applications are outdated and suffer from poor performance. Therefore, an intelligent heart disease diagnosis application design is required. In this research work, internet of things (IoT) sensor data with a deep learning-based heart diagnosis application is designed. The heart disease IoT sensor data is collected from the University of California Irvine machine learning repository free open-source dataset which is useful for training the deep graph convolutional network (DG_ConvoNet) deep learning network. The testing data has been collected from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation--it is a collection of 350 real-time clinical instances from heart patients through IoT sensors. The K-means technique is employed to remove noise in sensor data and clustered the unstructured data. The features are extracted to employ Linear Quadratic Discriminant Analysis. DG_ConvoNet is a deep learning process to classify and predict heart diseases. The diagnostic application achieves an accuracy of 96%, sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 73%, precision of 90%, F-Score of 79%, and area under the ROC curve of 75% implementing the proposed model.

As we delve deeper into the vast ocean of AI, we notice the various applications for processing available data and generating output based on the use case. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, which have become increasingly common in modern business and daily life, are also finding their way into healthcare. Artificial intelligence in healthcare services has the potential to help healthcare providers navigate multiple regulatory cycles and consumer perspectives. Though AI and healthcare breakthroughs have a big impact on the health sector, the techniques they support can change radically. Few of the research papers suggest that AI can leverage its computational abilities to do tasks better than humans, but it is going to take a long time to actually implement such systems. It is hoped that by incorporating artificial intelligence, it will be able to mimic human mental capacities and limitations. It is gaining a new perspective on constraint as access to healthcare, service information, and research methodologies advance at a rapid pace. Some of the major diseases that can be treated with AI approaches include cardiology, cancer, and neurology.

The applications of AI in the field of cardiovascular disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic were an added advantage to the cardiologists, as it helped in certain aspects of treatments digitally. This technology is constructive for providing sophisticated treatment in the area of cardiovascular medicine based on technology, because it may assist in assessing and measuring the human heart function. Artificial intelligence employs simulated neuronal program for predicting the survival of a COVID-19 patient affected with heart dysfunction. AI entails intricate algorithms for predicting successful evaluation and therefore the treatment protocol. AI utilizes various methods like cognitive computing, deep learning, and machine learning. It is integrated to make an assessment and determine multifaceted challenges. In humans, cardiovascular disease is still one of the major causes of death, and it is escalating for years together and is also very expensive. AI is employed to recognize new drug treatment and advance the efficacy of a clinician.

Experts manually examine these sounds, which is arduous and time-consuming. In addition, since interpreting these sounds requires experience, experts who do not have enough experience may misinterpret these sounds. For this reason, a new deep one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) architecture has been proposed to increase the detection accuracy and alleviate the workload of experts in the classification of sound signals used in the diagnosis of heart valve diseases. In the developed model, first, feature maps were obtained from heart sounds by using the MFCC method. High performance was achieved when the feature maps obtained later were classified in the developed deep architecture. Furthermore, the feature maps generated by the MFCC approach were classified using traditional machine learning classifiers. When the obtained results were compared, it was observed that the suggested deep model was more successful. In the developed architecture, an accuracy rate of 99.5% was obtained. The accuracy rate obtained shows that the developed architecture can be used to classify heart sounds and diagnose heart valve diseases. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.;artificial intelligence--cardiac disorder--classification--heart sound--MFCC;Artificial heart--Computer aided diagnosis--Convolutional neural networks--Heart--Learning systems--Network architecture--Accuracy rate--Automatic classification--Automatic diagnosis--Cardiac disorders--Classifieds--Feature map--Heart disease--Heart sounds--Heart valve disease--MFCC--Cardiology;John Wiley and Sons Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85134673068

A modern HCAD data prediction using multi-level regression and probabilistic adaptive random forest classification method is realized based on the MRI, CT, and CTA coronary artery dataset. This study classified CTA/MRI heart images using level set formulation and GHSB (Gaussian hue, saturation, and brightness). The GHSB is a fusion technology for identifying cardiac abnormalities through perfect consequences. The earlier and past technologies are not meeting the limitations such as efficiently fast and accurate results of heart abnormalities. Therefore, implementing a model with an adaptive filter and threshold segmentation-based classification approach improves HCAD detection time. This model increases the true-positive rate by operating the adaptive machine learning classifier. The segmentation and multi-level regression-based probabilistic random forest (RFO) classification model predicts the different coronary artery disorders. A DCNN (deep convolutional neural network)-based feature selection and image net classification model for coronary artery model is necessary for healthcare applications. GHSB and RFO models are applied in this research work on heart/MRI ultrasound images. This model accurately finds the CAB in the applied image and extracts the abnormality in the scanned data. In the next stage, AlexNet-DCNN classifier is used to locate the blockage width and length. Finally, 99.74% accuracy, 98.81% precision, 98.14% recall, 94.87% F1 score, 59.26% PSNR, 0.0989% CC (correlation coefficient), and 99.45% sensitivity are attained.

Currently, physicians rely on features of electrocardiograms (ECGs) to identify the most likely location of coronary arteries related to an infarct. We sought to predict these culprit arteries more accurately by using deep learning. Methods: A deep learning model with a convolutional neural network (CNN) that incorporated ECG signals was trained on 384 patients with STEMI who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at a medical center. The performances of various signal preprocessing methods (short-Time Fourier transform [STFT] and continuous wavelet transform [CWT]) with different lengths of input ECG signals were compared. The sensitivity and specificity for predicting each infarct-related artery and the overall accuracy were evaluated. Results: ECG signal preprocessing with STFT achieved fair overall prediction accuracy (79.3%). The sensitivity and specificity for predicting the left anterior descending artery (LAD) as the culprit vessel were 85.7% and 88.4%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for predicting the left circumflex artery (LCX) were 37% and 99%, respectively, and the sensitivity and specificity for predicting the right coronary artery (RCA) were 88.4% and 82.4%, respectively. Using CWT (Morlet wavelet) for signal preprocessing resulted in better overall accuracy (83.7%) compared with STFT preprocessing. The sensitivity and specificity were 93.46% and 80.39% for LAD, 56% and 99.7% for LCX, and 85.9% and 92.9% for RCA, respectively. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that deep learning with a CNN could facilitate the identification of the culprit coronary artery in patients with STEMI. Preprocessing ECG signals with CWT was demonstrated to be superior to doing so with STFT.  © 2013 IEEE.;Convolutional neural network--electrocardiography--machine learning--percutaneous coronary intervention--STEMI;Coronary Vessels--Deep Learning--Heart--Humans--Percutaneous Coronary Intervention--ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction--Blood vessels--Cardiology--Convolution--Deep learning--Electrocardiograms--Heart--Hospitals--Medical imaging--Neural networks--Patient treatment--Wavelet transforms--Artery--Convolutional neural network--Lesion--Machine-learning--Medical diagnostic imaging--Myocardial Infarction--Myocardium--Percutaneous coronary intervention--Sensitivity and specificity--ST elevation myocardial infarction--adult--artery lesion--Article--continuous wavelet transform--controlled study--convolutional neural network--coronary artery--coronary artery circumflex branch--deep learning--diagnostic accuracy--diagnostic imaging--diagnostic test accuracy study--electrocardiogram--electrocardiography--female--human--left anterior descending coronary artery--major clinical study--male--middle aged--percutaneous coronary intervention--prediction--right coronary artery--sensitivity and specificity--short time Fourier transform--ST segment elevation myocardial infarction--coronary blood vessel--heart--percutaneous coronary intervention--ST segment elevation myocardial infarction--surgery--Forecasting;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;36654772;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85144760053

Although the years have changed, throngs of patients are diagnosed with this lethal disease and not only is it not decreasing, but increasing and this is evident from the analysis of death rates across the country. Heart disease is caused by several main factors such as negligence in taking care of diet and daily life. Causes such as age and genetics cannot be fully controlled by humans. So it is the responsibility of each individual to take care of critical risk factors that can be controlled by humans. Innovation and data mining technology should also help to reduce the death rate caused by heart disease. Existing data should be used to find hidden relationships, which are very useful for early diagnosis, which can be a new advanced technology and potentially improve the level of the national health system. This paper underlines previous studies that leverage machine learning and deep learning expertise to predict heart disease.

The segmentation of the left ventricle of echocardiography videos plays an essential role in cardiology for carrying out clinical cardiac diagnosis and monitoring the patient’s condition. Most of the developed deep learning algorithms for video segmentation require an enormous amount of labeled data to generate accurate results. Thus, there is a need to develop new semi-supervised segmentation methods due to the scarcity and costly labeled data. In recent research, semi-supervised learning approaches based on graph signal processing emerged in computer vision due to their ability to avail the geometrical structure of data. Video object segmentation can be considered as a node classification problem. In this paper, we propose a new approach called GraphECV based on the use of graph signal processing for semi-supervised learning of video object segmentation applied for the segmentation of the left ventricle in echordiography videos. GraphECV includes instance segmentation, extraction of temporal, texture and statistical features to represent the nodes, construction of a graph using K-nearest neighbors, graph sampling to embed the graph with small amount of labeled nodes or graph signals, and finally a semi-supervised learning approach based on the minimization of the Sobolov norm of graph signals. The new algorithm is evaluated using two publicly available echocardiography videos, EchoNet-Dynamic and CAMUS datasets. The proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods under challenging background conditions. © 2022 by the authors.;deep learning--echocardiography--graph signal processing--semi-supervised learning--video object segmentation;;MDPI;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85141581544

Due to non-invasive qualities, the Electrocardiogram (ECG) has become a commonly employed auxiliary diagnostic index for heart problems in pre-screening and give information of heart diseases. Many methods are used to find out the abnormalities in heartbeat. In this paper survey is done to find out what are the methods used to classify the ECG recordings to predict cardiovascular diseases which affects middle aged as well as older people causing severe illness leading to death. One of the major abnormality was due to arrhythmia disease. Hence many deep learning methods were used to find early prediction of arrhythmia to save lives of people. From the survey it is found that many ECG classifications done using existing database such as MIT-BIH arrhythmia. Most of the methods work on classifications, feature extractions to find abnormalities in ECG signals and found to have higher accuracies of more than 94%.In this paper, the study is based on abnormalities in ECG signals due to arrhythmia and its identification using a network architecture based on LSTM and CNN deep learning methods.

These changes can mask pathological changes, making them harder to diagnose and increasing the risk of an adverse cardiac outcome. Aim: This paper reviews which machine learning techniques (ML) are being used within athlete’s heart research and how they are being implemented, as well as assesses the uptake of these techniques within this area of research. Methods: Searches were carried out on the Scopus and PubMed online datasets and a scoping review was conducted on the studies which were identified. Results: Twenty-eight studies were included within the review, with ML being directly referenced within 16 (57%). A total of 12 different techniques were used, with the most popular being artificial neural networks and the most common implementation being to perform classification tasks. The review also highlighted the subgroups of interest: predictive modelling, reviews, and wearables, with most of the studies being attributed to the predictive modelling subgroup. The most common type of data used was the electrocardiogram (ECG), with echocardiograms being used the second most often. Conclusion: The results show that over the last 11 years, there has been a growing desire of leveraging ML techniques to help further the understanding of the athlete’s heart, whether it be by expanding the knowledge of the physiological changes or by improving the accuracies of models to help improve the treatments and disease management. © 2022 by the authors.;athlete’s heart--cardiology--echocardiography--electrocardiography--machine learning--pre-participation screening;artificial intelligence--artificial neural network--athlete--athletic performance--body movement--bradycardia--cardiovascular magnetic resonance--cardiovascular risk--congestive cardiomyopathy--convolutional neural network--coronary artery anomaly--coronary artery disease--decision support system--deep learning--diagnostic accuracy--discrete Fourier transform--echocardiography--electrocardiogram--electrocardiography--elite athlete--endurance training--heart--heart disease--heart left bundle branch block--heart right ventricle dysplasia--hierarchical clustering--human--hypertrophic cardiomyopathy--image analysis--k nearest neighbor--long QT syndrome--long short term memory network--machine learning--Marfan syndrome--medical research--medical society--Medline--myocarditis--predictive model--random forest--Review--Scopus--sport injury--sports medicine--sudden cardiac death--support vector machine--systematic review (topic)--tachycardia--team sport--Wolff Parkinson White syndrome;MDPI;;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85141630635

The aim of this review is to describe the contemporary state of AI and digital health applied to cardiomyopathies as well as to define a potential pivotal role of its application by physicians in clinical practice. Recent Findings: Many studies have been undertaken in recent years on cardiomyopathy screening especially using AI-enhanced electrocardiography (ECG). Even with mild left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, AI-ECG screening for amyloidosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or dilated cardiomyopathy is now feasible. Introduction of AI-ECG in routine clinical care has resulted in higher detection of LV systolic dysfunction--however, clinical research on a broader scale with diverse populations is necessary and ongoing. In the area of cardiac-imaging, AI automatically assesses the thickness and characteristics of myocardium to differentiate cardiomyopathies, but research on its prognostic capability has yet to be conducted. AI is also being applied to cardiomyopathy genomics, especially to predict pathogenicity of variants and identify whether these variants are clinically actionable. Summary: While the implementation of AI in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiomyopathies is still in its infancy, an ever-growing clinical research strategy will ascertain the clinical utility of these AI tools to help improve diagnosis of and outcomes in cardiomyopathies. We also need to standardize the tools used to monitor the performance of AI-based systems which can then be used to expedite decision-making and rectify any hidden biases. Given its potential important role in clinical practice, healthcare providers need to familiarize themselves with the promise and limitations of this technology. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.;Artificial intelligence--Cardiomyopathy--Dilated cardiomyopathy--Genetics--Heart failure--Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy;Artificial Intelligence--Cardiomyopathies--Genomics--Humans--amyloidosis--artificial intelligence--artificial neural network--cardiac imaging--cardiomyopathy--cardiovascular magnetic resonance--cardiovascular risk--clinical decision making--clinical outcome--clinical practice--congestive cardiomyopathy--deep learning--diagnostic accuracy--electrocardiography--genomics--health service--heart failure--heart left ventricle failure--human--hypertrophic cardiomyopathy--machine learning--pathogenicity--patient care--prognosis--Review--screening--cardiomyopathy;Springer;36048306;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85137253639

This is a condition that affects a big portion of the world's population. When we examine the death rate and the enormous number of people who suffer from heart disease, it becomes clear how critical early detection of heart disease is. There are numerous established approaches for predicting such sickness, but they do not appear to be adequate. There is an immediate need for a medical diagnosis system that can anticipate heart disease early on and provide a more accurate diagnosis than standard approaches such as Logistic Regularization, Lasso, Elastic Network, and Group Lasso regularisation. Nowadays, machine learning approaches are gaining a lot of traction. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are utilised in this paper to create a system for early stage prediction and medical diagnosis. CNN receives 13 clinical features as input. The CNN is trained using a modified back propagation training approach. During testing, it was discovered that CNN predicts the absence and presence of cardiac disease with greater than 95 percent accuracy. In this investigation, we present CardioHelp, a method that uses a deep learning algorithm known as convolutional neural networks to predict whether or not a patient will have cardiovascular disease (CNN). In order to model temporal data, the suggested technique makes use of CNN for early HF prediction. We compiled a dataset on heart disease and used cutting-edge algorithms to compare our findings. The results were promising. © 2023 IEEE.;classifying Cardiomegaly Disease etc.--Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)--Image Classification--Image Segmentation;Cardiology--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Forecasting--Heart--Image classification--Image segmentation--Learning algorithms--Cardiomegaly--Classifying cardiomegaly disease etc.--Convolutional neural network--Fatal disease--Heart disease--Images classification--Images segmentations--Neural network model--Regularisation--Diseases;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85149526272

It may be possible to bring down the overall death rate of individuals if cardiovascular disease can be detected in its earlier stages. If the cardiac disease is detected at an earlier stage, there is a greater possibility that it may be successfully treated and managed under the guidance of a physician. Recent advances in areas such as the Internet of Things, cloud storage, and machine learning have given rise to renewed optimism over the capacity of technology to bring about a paradigm change on a global scale. At the bedside, the use of sensors to capture vital signs has grown increasingly commonplace in recent years. Patients are manually monitored using a monitor located at the patient's bedside--there is no automatic data processing taking place. These results, which came from an investigation of cardiovascular disease carried out across a large number of hospitals, have been used in the development of a protocol for the early, automated, and intelligent identification of heart disorders. The PASCAL data set is prepared by collecting data from different hospitals using the digital stethoscope. This data set is publicly available, and it is used by many researchers around the world in experimental work. The proposed strategy for doing research includes three steps. The first stage is known as the data collection phase, the data is collected using biosensors and IoT devices through wireless sensor networks. In the second step, all of the information pertaining to healthcare is uploaded to the cloud so that it may be analyzed. The last step in the process is training the model using data taken from already-existing medical records. Deep learning strategies are used in order to classify the sound that is produced by the heart. The deep CNN algorithm is used for sound feature extraction and classification. The PASCAL data set is essential to the functioning of the experimental environment. The deep CNN model is performing most accurately.  © 2023 Muhammad Shafiq et al.;;Cardiology--Data acquisition--Data handling--Deep learning--Developing countries--Digital storage--Diseases--Heart--Hospitals--Learning systems--Wireless sensor networks--Cardiovascular disease--Causes of death--Data set--Death rates--Disease detection--E health--Health systems--Heart disease--Sensors network--World Health Organization--Internet of things;Hindawi Limited;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85157988742

In India alone, every minute, around one person passes away from heart disease. To decrease the number of fatality brought on by heart diseases, an efficient and quick detection technique is needed. How often does every odd guy experience the cardiovascular disease as a result of a sedentary lifestyle and bad eating habits? They require health surveillance at least every year in order to understand the condition of the human body, particularly the heart. Not only that, but in the case of elderly people who are alone at home and require ongoing medical assistance, we require a gadget that allows us to effortlessly keep any patient within monitoring and monitor various heart vitals at all times. The IoT sensors are utilized and the body parameters are monitored and captured namely, cholesterol level, lipid LDL, lipids HDL, randomized sugar or sugar levels, QT intervals, PR period, hemoglobin status, and oxygen levels are some of the measurements that should be made. Based on the IoT environment, the sensors utilized such as BP sensor, ECG sensor, and pulse rate sensor to retrieve information from patients. In addition to that, the researcher focused on the new sensor with a lot of advantages and utilized the photo diode sensor as an innovative one to monitor the heart rate and glucose level or random sugar level. It is helping physicians identify cardiac disease at a early stage and prevent the deaths of thousands of people. © 2023 IEEE.;Deep learning--Detection System--Machine Learning--Monitoring System;Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Hemoglobin--Internet of things--Learning systems--Cardiovascular disease--Condition--Deep learning--Detection system--Efficient detection--Heart disease--Machine-learning--Monitoring system--Quickest detection--Sugar levels--Heart;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85158123267

The main reason behind the heart disease is our busy life, as the person is affected not only by office work but also by personal problems. This mortality rate is too high. We can predict this disease with the help of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) prediction models. In this paper, to reach the accuracy we worked on three ML & DL models. For this paper we use ML models named as: SVM (Support Vector Machine), LR (Logistic Regression) & Naïve Bayes. DL models named as: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) & LSTM (Long Short Term Memory). The accuracy obtained in this study is made up of the 85% accuracy of Logistic Regression, the 89% accuracy of SVM, and the 85% accuracy of Naive Bayes. LSTM has an accuracy of 83%, RNN has an accuracy of 91%, and CNN has an accuracy of 83%.

Early detection of heart conditions and clinical care can lower the death rate. Based on the patient's various cardiac features, we proposed a model for forecasting heart disease and identifying impending heart disease using machine learning techniques such logistic regression, SVM, Multinomial Nave Bayes, Random Forest, and Decision Tree. In most cases, input is received through numerical data of various parameters, and output findings are generated in real-time, predicting whether or not the patient has a disease. We'll use a variety of supervised machine learning methods before deciding which one is best for the model.

The solution through conventional analytical methods demands advanced electronics and computing systems, which limits the feasibility of CNT-based biosensors in near-patient settings considering the device size, cost, and usability. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) assisted solution by analyzing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data generated by CNT thin film (CNT-TF) biosensors in response to B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) for the diagnosis and management of heart failure (HF). We trained a deep neural network to predict the BNP level, where a K-fold cross-validation was used to optimize the network structure. This algorithm circumvents the error-prone analytical methods that require calibration curves, and significantly enhanced the reliability of diagnostic results without the need for advanced hardware or major design change. We first demonstrated the feasibility of our method using EIS data acquired in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then applied the algorithm to venous blood samples collected from HF patients. Overall, an out-of-sample prediction accuracy of 80.0% (and an in-sample accuracy of 97.2%) was achieved for the PBS data and 80.0% (95.6%) for the clinical data, which shows that ML-assisted algorithms greatly improve the performance and applicability of CNT-TF biosensors in point-of-care testing.

Detecting the presence or potential heart disease of the fetus as soon as possible, and adopting relevant treatment plans in a timely manner, which has a profound impact on doctors and patients. This study aims to develop an accurate screening method with arrhythmia (ARR) to assist physicians to further diagnose whether them have heart disease. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-domain feature extraction technique and a hierarchical extreme learning machine (H-ELM) network for the prediction of fetal ARR. Firstly, the multi-domain feature extraction technology is used to extract abundant high-dimensional feature for representing the original signal. Secondly, neighborhood component analysis (NCA) is used to screen the sensitive features from the high dimensional feature vectors. Then, the obtained sensitive features are input into stacked extreme learning machine sparse autoencoder (ELM-SAE), which extract high-level fusion features by layer-by-layer unsupervised learning manner. Finally, an original ELM was connected on the end of the ELM-SAE network for the prediction of fetal ARR. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can achieve sensitivity of 99.11%, specificity of 93.91%, precision of 93.52%, and accuracy of 96.33%. Furthermore, the proposed method comprehensive performance outperforms the compared models. Therefore, the proposed method can be effectively used for the prediction of fetal ARR, and with the continuous improved the research, it is expected to be considered as an auxiliary diagnostic tool for physicians in the future. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd;Fetal ARR prediction--Hierarchical extreme learning machine--Multi-domain feature--NCA--Non-invasive fetal electrocardiography;Cardiology--Diagnosis--Diseases--Extraction--Feature extraction--Heart--Knowledge acquisition--Patient treatment--Fetal arrhythmia prediction--Fetal arrhythmias--Fetal electrocardiographies--Heart disease--Hierarchical extreme learning machine--Higher dimensional features--Learning machines--Multi-domain features--Neighborhood component analysis--Non-invasive fetal electrocardiography--Article--autoencoder--blind source separation--classifier--controlled study--deep neural network--diagnostic test accuracy study--empirical mode decomposition--entropy--feature extraction--feature selection--fetus--fetus electrocardiography--heart arrhythmia--hierarchical extreme learning machine--human--linear dimensionality reduction--machine learning--major clinical study--non invasive measurement--performance indicator--sparse autoencoder--support vector machine--Forecasting;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85138143213

These days, cardiovascular diseases are getting complicated. People between the ages of 40–60 are mostly affected due to heart disease. The current state of digital health and artificial intelligence is useful for cardiovascular disease diagnosis. So, this research provides the accurate classification of patients suffering from cardiovascular disease or not. To improve and optimize the diagnosis methods for cardiovascular disease, artificial intelligence (Machine learning and deep learning) has the ability to change the way of cardiology practicing. Various machine learning and deep learning algorithms, i.e., artificial neural network, adaptive boosting, XGBoost, random forest, decision tree, Naïve Bayes, stochastic gradient descent, K-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, are used in this research.

The phonocardiograph is the equipment that records these sounds. It is one of the less noticeable systems that capture cardiac status in auditory form. The opening and shutting of the heart valves produce cardiac sounds. Heart sounds are produced by blood flow via the orifices of the valves or into the ventricular chambers. The PCG signal comprises four major cardiac sound constituents: Sl, S2, S3, and S4. Sl and S2 are typical sounds, however, S3 and S4 are deemed abnormal. After obtaining the data from the PCG records, the necessary characteristics are retrieved using signal processing methods. Later, feature selection methods are implemented to get optimal solutions swiftly. The last portion is divided into two categories: normal and abnormal. The classification methods are then applied to four classes: Sl and S2, S3, and S4.  © 2023 IEEE.;CNN--Feature extraction--Gradient boosting--Heart sounds--Random Forest--RNN--SVM;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Deep learning--Feature Selection--Heart--Phonocardiography--Features extraction--Gradient boosting--Heart sounds--Integrated signal processing--Learning techniques--Phonocardiograms--Random forests--RNN--Sound classification--SVM--Support vector machines;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85161191724

However, ECG is infeasible for continuous cardiac monitoring due to its requirement for user participation. By contrast, photoplethysmography (PPG) provides easy-to-collect data, but its limited accuracy constrains its clinical usage. To combine the advantages of both signals, recent studies incorporate various deep learning techniques for the reconstruction of PPG signals to ECG--however, the lack of contextual information as well as the limited abilities to denoise biomedical signals ultimately constrain model performance. In this research, we propose Performer, a novel Transformer-based architecture that reconstructs ECG from PPG and combines the PPG and reconstructed ECG as multiple modalities for CVD detection. This method is the first time that Transformer sequence-to-sequence translation has been performed on biomedical waveform reconstruction, combining the advantages of both PPG and ECG. We also create Shifted Patch-based Attention (SPA), an effective method to encode/decode the biomedical waveforms. Through fetching the various sequence lengths and capturing cross-patch connections, SPA maximizes the signal processing for both local features and global contextual representations. The proposed architecture generates a state-of-the-art performance of 0.29 RMSE for the reconstruction of PPG to ECG on the BIDMC database, surpassing prior studies. We also evaluated this model on the MIMIC-III dataset, achieving a 95.9% accuracy in CVD detection, and on the PPG-BP dataset, achieving 75.9% accuracy in related CVD diabetes detection, indicating its generalizability.

Various ML approaches have successfully been applied to cardiovascular tests and diseases to automate interpretation, accurately perform measurements, and, in some cases, predict novel diagnoses from less invasive tests, effectively expanding the utility of more widely accessible diagnostic tests.

This study aimed to predict mitral regurgitation (MR) and mitral stenosis (MS) RHD among children with RHD. Methodology: Data was collected from the Pediatric Cardiology Department at Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi Institute of Cardiology Multan, Pakistan from March to October 2019. A sample of 561 children aged 4–14 years, who were diagnosed with RHD of either MR or MS, were recruited from the hospital’s outpatient department. The presence of multivariate outliers was detected, and different machine learning methods, including subset logistic regression, subset logistic regression after deletion, stepwise winsorized logistic regression, robust logistic regression, subset deep neural network, and random forest models were compared using the area under receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, sensitivity, and specificity. Parsimony was also considered in model selection. Results: Out of 561 patients in this study, 75.94% had RHD MR and 24.06% had RHD MS. The average age of study participants was 9.19 ± 2.45 years and of them 55.43% were male. Among the male participants, 58.6 and 45.2% had MR and MS, respectively--and among female participants, those were 70.4 and 29.6%, respectively. Subset logistic regression after deletion appeared as competitive with a discrimination power of 90.1% [95% CI 0.818–0.983]. The sensitivity and specificity of this model were 85.1 and 70.6%. Conclusion: The best predictive model was subset logistic regression after deletion. The predicted method will be used in the decision-making process, which helps early diagnosis of the disease and leads to prevention. The study findings provide the proper guideline for earlier diagnosis of the RHD MR and MS cases among children with RHD in Pakistan.

Detecting heart disease in its initial stages before a cardiac event takes place poses challenges. Huge amount of heart disease data is available in the health care sector such as in clinics, hospitals etc. However, this data is not intelligently handled to identify the hidden patterns. Machine learning techniques help in turning this medical data into useful knowledge. Machine learning is used to design such decision support systems (DSS) that can learn and improve from their past experiences. Recently, deep learning has gained the interest of industry and academics. The fundamental objective of this research activity is the precise diagnosis of heart illness. The suggested approach makes use of a Keras-based deep learning model to compute results with a dense neural network. The proposed model undergoes testing with various configurations of hidden layers in the dense neural network, ranging from 3 layers to 9 layers. Each hidden layer employs 100 neurons and utilizes the Relu activation function. To carry out the analysis, several heart disease datasets are utilized as benchmarks. The assessment encompasses both individual and ensemble models, and is performed on all heart disease datasets. Furthermore, using important measures like sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and f-measure, the dense neural network is assessed across all datasets. The performance of different layer combinations varies across datasets due to varying attribute categories. Through extensive experimentation, the results of the proposed framework are analyzed. The study's conclusions show that, when applied to all heart disease datasets, the deep learning model suggested in this research paper achieves superior accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared to individual models and alternative ensemble approaches.  © 2013 IEEE.;accuracy--cross validation--decision support system--deep learning--ensemble classifiers--heart disease diagnosis--Machine learning--performance;Cardiology--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Heart--Medical imaging--Accuracy--Cross validation--Deep learning--Ensemble learning--Ensemble-classifier--Heart disease diagnosis--Machine-learning--Medical diagnostic imaging--Performance--Decision support systems;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85162649320

Deep learning is emerging as a powerful tool to better understand AF and improve its treatment, which remains suboptimal. This paper aims to provide a solution to automatically identify rotational activity drivers in endocardial electrograms (EGMs) with convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNNs). The CRNN model was compared with two other state-of-the-art methods (SimpleCNN and attention-based time-incremental convolutional neural network (ATI-CNN)) for different input signals (unipolar EGMs, bipolar EGMs, and unipolar local activation times), sampling frequencies, and signal lengths. The proposed CRNN obtained a detection score based on the Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.680, an ATI-CNN score of 0.401, and a SimpleCNN score of 0.118, with bipolar EGMs as input signals exhibiting better overall performance. In terms of signal length and sampling frequency, no significant differences were found.

Myocardial infarction (MI) results in heart muscle injury due to receiving insufficient blood flow. MI is the most common cause of mortality in middle-aged and elderly individuals worldwide. To diagnose MI, clinicians need to interpret electrocardiography (ECG) signals, which requires expertise and is subject to observer bias. Artificial intelligence-based methods can be utilized to screen for or diagnose MI automatically using ECG signals. Approach. In this work, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of artificial intelligence-based approaches for MI detection based on ECG and some other biophysical signals, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. The performance of traditional ML methods relies on handcrafted features and manual selection of ECG signals, whereas DL models can automate these tasks. Main results. The review observed that deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) yielded excellent classification performance for MI diagnosis, which explains why they have become prevalent in recent years. Significance. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey of artificial intelligence techniques employed for MI diagnosis using ECG and some other biophysical signals. © 2022 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.;deep convolutional neural network--deep learning--diagnosis--electrocardiogram--machine learning--myocardial infarction disease;Aged--Artificial Intelligence--Electrocardiography--Humans--Machine Learning--Middle Aged--Myocardial Infarction--Neural Networks, Computer--Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Computer aided diagnosis--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep neural networks--Learning systems--Artificial intelligence techniques--Automated detection--Convolutional neural network--Deep convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Heart muscles--Learning models--Machine-learning--Myocardial Infarction--Myocardial infarction disease--aged--artificial intelligence--electrocardiography--heart infarction--human--machine learning--middle aged--procedures--Electrocardiograms;Institute of Physics;35803247;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85135596746

A major goal of cardiovascular medicine has been to understand how genetic variation leads to the clinical heterogeneity seen in polygenic cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Recent advances and emerging technologies in artificial intelligence (AI), coupled with the ever-increasing availability of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, now provide researchers with unprecedented possibilities for dynamic and complex biological genomic analyses. Combining these technologies may lead to a deeper understanding of heterogeneous polygenic CVDs, better prognostic guidance, and, ultimately, greater personalized medicine. Advances will likely be achieved through increasingly frequent and robust genomic characterization of patients, as well the integration of genomic data with other clinical data, such as cardiac imaging, coronary angiography, and clinical biomarkers. This review discusses the current opportunities and limitations of genomics--provides a brief overview of AI--and identifies the current applications, limitations, and future directions of AI in genomics. © 2022 by the authors.

Despite the low incidence of MI in the world, it is still a common disease-causing death. Therefore, detecting the MI signals early can reduce mortality. This paper presented a method based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for the detection of MI automatically. The proposed CNN is an end-to-end model without requiring any stages of machine learning and requires only one stage to detect MI from the input signals. In the case of imbalanced data, we optimize our deep model with a new loss function named the focal loss to deal with this case by constituting the loss indirectly the focus in those difficult classes. The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) dataset was employed in the validation to classify the signals to normal and MI. The performance of our technique alongside state-of-the-art in the area shows an increase in terms of average accuracy and F1 score. Results show that focal loss improves the detection accuracy by 9% for detecting MI signals. In summary, the proposed method achieved an overall accuracy, precision, F1 score, and recall of 98.84%, 98.31%, 97.92%, and 97.63, respectively using focal loss and overall accuracy of 89.72%, a precision of 88.52%, a recall of 81.11% and F1 score of 83.02% without using focal loss. Our method using focal loss is an effective tool to perform a fast and reliable MI diagnosis to assist the cardiologists in detecting MI early. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.;CNN--End-to-end--Focal loss--Imbalanced data--Myocardial infarction--PTB;Blood--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Convolutional neural networks--Deep neural networks--Diagnosis--Common disease--Detection accuracy--End-to-end models--Imbalanced data--Myocardial Infarction--Overall accuracies--Physikalisch-technische bundesanstalt--State of the art--Signal detection;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85099187756

The physical model is an in-silico cardiac computational model, consisting of a four-chambered heart with electrophysiology, hemodynamic, and blood pressure auto-regulation functionality. Starting with a small number of measured PPG data, the cardiac model is used to synthesize healthy as well as PPG time-series pertaining to coronary artery disease (CAD) by varying pathophysiological parameters. A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) structure is proposed to derive a statistical feature space for CAD classification. Results are presented in two perspectives namely, (i) using artificially reduced real disease data and (ii) using all the real disease data. In both cases, by augmenting with the synthetic data for training, the performance (sensitivity, specificity) of the classifier changes from (i) (0.65, 1) to (1, 0.9) and (ii) (1, 0.95) to (1, 1). The proposed hybrid approach of combining physical modelling and statistical feature space selection generates realistic PPG data with pathophysiological interpretation and can outperform a baseline Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture with a relatively small amount of real data for training. This proposed method could aid as a substitution technique for handling the problem of bulk data required for training machine learning algorithms for cardiac health-care applications. © 2013 IEEE.;Cardiac computational model--coronary artery disease--photoplethysmogram--synthetic data--variational autoencoder;Algorithms--Cardiovascular System--Coronary Artery Disease--Hemodynamics--Humans--Machine Learning--Bioinformatics--Blood pressure--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Computational methods--Computer aided design--Computer aided diagnosis--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Electrophysiology--Heart--Learning algorithms--Machine learning--Physiological models--Auto encoders--Cardiac computational model--Computational modelling--Coronary artery disease--Haemodynamics--Photoplethysmogram--Physical modelling--Solid modelling--Synthetic data--Variational autoencoder--Article--autoencoder--automation--cardiovascular system--classifier--computer model--controlled study--convolutional neural network--coronary artery disease--deep learning--disease classification--electrophysiology--feature selection--heart muscle fiber membrane potential--hemodynamics--human--learning algorithm--machine learning--major clinical study--mathematical model--photoelectric plethysmography--physical model--pressoreceptor reflex--QRS interval--sensitivity and specificity--support vector machine--synthetic data--time series analysis--algorithm--Computation theory;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;35104231;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85124180275

Novel and instigating teaching methods were required to improve the learning experience and so recent implementations of the annual PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology (CinC) Challenges posed as a reference. For over 20 years, the challenges have proven repeatedly to be of immense educational value, besides leading to technological advances for specific problems. In this paper, we report results from the class 'Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Challenge', which was implemented as an online project seminar at Technical University Darmstadt, Germany, and which was heavily inspired by the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2017 'AF Classification from a Short Single Lead ECG Recording'. Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac disease and often remains undetected. Therefore, we selected the two most promising models of the course and give an insight into the Transformer-based DualNet architecture as well as into the CNN-LSTM-based model and finally a detailed analysis for both. In particular, we show the model performance results of our internal scoring process for all submitted models and the near state-of-the-art model performance for the two named models on the official 2017 challenge test set. Several teams were able to achieve F1 scores above/close to 90% on a hidden test-set of Holter recordings. We highlight themes commonly observed among participants, and report the results from the self-assessed student evaluation. Finally, the self-assessment of the students reported a notable increase in machine learning knowledge.  © 2022 The Author(s).

According to the WHO, cardiovascular disease killed more than 32% of the world's population in 2019. Arrhythmia is one of the symptoms of CVD that can be identified as a pattern of abnormal electrical impulses to the myocardium that can cause the heart to beat too quickly or too slowly, reducing its ability to pump blood properly and increasing mortality risk. In particular, AI, which includes Deep Learning (DL) or Machine Learning (ML), is contributing to the real-time expansion and complexity of big data in the healthcare industry. AI will make prediction easier for doctors to diagnose the symptoms of arrhythmia based on its signals. In this research, Multi-GANs give the best-generated data in 3000 epochs with the minimum percentage of loss discriminator system to identify if the data is fake or not, and also with the maximum error in loss generator system to create more variance in the generated data, including noise feature. To train the data, we use DNN models i.e. CNN, Resnet-101, and Densenet-121, which produce substantial training and validating outcomes. By testing the purpose of DNN's accuracy, precision, recall, and Fl-score, it brings the best results with correct prediction of classes in normal, atrial premature, premature ventricular contraction, a fusion of ventricular and normal, and a fusion of paced and normal, respectively. For 20 epochs and 100 batches, we get an accuracy of 99.7609 percent for the CNN model and also 100 percent in precision, recall, and Fl-score, which is the best DNN model so far in this paper. © 2022 IEEE.;accuracy--arrhythmia--classification--Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)--Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs);Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Neural network models--Accuracy--Arrhythmia--Arrhythmia classification--Cardiac death--Cardiovascular disease--Deep neural network--Disease cause--Generative adversarial network--Neural network model--Tabular data--Generative adversarial networks;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85149520696

This review summarizes the current state and future perspectives of AI for automated imaging analysis in invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Recent Findings: Recently, 12 studies on AI for automated imaging analysis In ICA have been published. In these studies, machine learning (ML) models have been developed for frame selection, segmentation, lesion assessment, and functional assessment of coronary flow. These ML models have been developed on monocenter datasets (in range 31–14,509 patients) and showed moderate to good performance. However, only three ML models were externally validated. Summary: Given the current pace of AI developments for the analysis of ICA, less-invasive, objective, and automated diagnosis of CAD can be expected in the near future. Further research on this technology in the catheterization laboratory may assist and improve treatment allocation, risk stratification, and cath lab logistics by integrating ICA analysis with other clinical characteristics. © 2022, The Author(s).;Artificial intelligence--Coronary angiography--Coronary stenosis--Deep learning--Image processing;Artificial Intelligence--Coronary Angiography--Coronary Artery Disease--Coronary Stenosis--Humans--Myocardial Ischemia--angiography--artificial intelligence--classification--clinical feature--convolutional neural network--coronary angiography--coronary artery blood flow--coronary stenosis--deep learning--functional assessment--health care utilization--human--image analysis--image processing--image segmentation--invasive coronary angiography--ischemic heart disease--machine learning--Review--risk assessment--SYNTAX score--treatment planning--artificial intelligence--coronary angiography--coronary artery disease--coronary artery obstruction--diagnostic imaging--heart muscle ischemia--procedures;Springer;35347566;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85127201333

BANs furnish different techniques to monitor activities in various medical field applications to accurately detect heart disease. Forgiving efficient treatment for heart disease to heart patients, exact prediction is more important in medical research. A machine learning model over health care data is an important goal for heart disease prediction. Different machine learning techniques have been used in existing research that pointed out inaccurate decision-making over clinical data obtained--some improvements are needed to predict heart disease before a heart attack occurs accurately. This paper proposes an intelligent framework for heart disease prediction using edge computing, Cloud computing and ensemble learning techniques. The proposed system is evaluated with heart disease data and compared with traditional ensemble classifiers based on precision, weighting techniques and temporal metrics like arbitration delay and computational expense.

Heart-related disorders demand higher precision, consistency, and accuracy in diagnosis and prognosis because even a small mistake might lead to death. Heart-related deaths are common, and the number of these deaths is rising rapidly day by day. Heart disease (HD) prediction with an acceptable level of accuracy is attainable by using cutting-edge machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. Making an accurate model using these algorithms can predict and categorize cardiovascular illness with high accuracy and reduce medical testing and human intervention. In this study an assessment between ML and DL was carried out to improve classification models for heart disease prediction based on related performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-1 score, and AUC curve) using a benchmark dataset from UCI machine learning databases of heart disease. which consists of 14 different heart disease-related features. Extreme Gradient Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Ada Boost, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, CatBoost, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Ridge, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K Neighbors, SVM-Linear Kernel, Naive Bayes, and deep neural networks, DNN3(3-layer network) and DNN4(4-layer network) are just a few of the classification models that are successfully used in this work for classification tasks. The highest classification accuracy was attained with the Extreme Gradient Boosting classifier (81.10%) (among the machine learning classifiers). The three layer deep neural network (DNN3) among deep learning approaches has provided the best accuracy of 85.41% when using selected features as input. The gathered results showed that deep neural networks outperformed machine learning techniques.  © 2022 IEEE.;Artificial Neural Network--DNN3--Gradient Boosting classifier--Heart Disease--Machine Learning Algorithms;Adaptive boosting--Benchmarking--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Decision trees--Diagnosis--Diseases--Forecasting--Heart--Learning systems--Logistic regression--Multilayer neural networks--Random forests--Support vector machines--Boosting classifiers--Classification models--DNN3--Gradient boosting--Gradient boosting classifier--Heart disease--High-accuracy--Layer networks--Machine learning algorithms--Machine-learning--Deep neural networks;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85150200852

Nevertheless, radar-based human identification has been limited to a few motion-based biometrics that are solely reliant on micro-Doppler signatures. This paper proposes for the first time the use of combined radar-based heart sound and gait signals as biometrics for human identification. The proposed methodology starts by converting the extracted biometric signatures collected from 18 subjects to images, and then an image augmentation technique is applied and the deep transfer learning is used to classify each subject. A validation accuracy of 58.7% and 96% is reported for the heart sound and gait biometrics, respectively. Next, the identification results of the two biometrics are combined using the joint probability mass function (PMF) method to report a 98% identification accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest reported in the literature to date. Lastly, the trained networks are tested in an actual scenario while being used in an office access control platform to identify different human subjects.

Therefore, the goal of this paper is to propose a deep learning–based prediction model of occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during the 1, 6, 12 month follow-up after hospital admission in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients using knowledge mining. We used the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry (KAMIR) dataset, a cardiovascular disease database registered in 52 hospitals in Korea between 1 January, 2005, and 31 December, 2008. Among 14,885 AMI patients, 10,813 subjects in age from 20 to 100 years with the 1-year follow-up traceability without coding errors were finally selected. For our experiment, the training/validation/test dataset split is 60/20/20 by random sampling without replacement. The preliminary deep learning model was first built by applying training and validation datasets and then a new preliminary deep learning model was generated using the best hyperparameters obtained from random hyperparameter grid search. Lastly, the preliminary prediction model of MACE occurrences in AMI patients is evaluated by test dataset. Compared with conventional regression-based models, the performances of machine/deep learning–based prediction models of the MACE occurrence in patients with AMI, including deep neural network (DNN), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and generalized linear model (GLM), are also evaluated through a matrix with sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The prediction results of the MACE occurrence during the 1, 6, and 12-month follow-up in AMI patients were the AUC of DNN (1 M 0.97, 6 M 0.94, 12 M 0.96), GBM (0.96, 0.95, 0.96), and GLM (0.76, 0.67, 0.72) in machine learning–based models as well as GRACE (0.75, 0.72, 0.76) in regression model. Compared with previous models, our deep learning–based prediction models significantly had the accuracy of 95% or higher and outperformed all machine learning and regression-based prediction models. This paper was the first trial of deep learning–based prediction model of the MACE occurrence in AMI clinical data. We found that the proposed prediction model applied different risk factors except the attribute “age” by using knowledge mining and directly used the raw data as input. © 2019, The Author(s).;Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)--Cardiac event--Decision support system--Deep learning–based MACE prediction model--Deep neural network--Knowledge and personal computing;Cardiology--Coding errors--Data mining--Decision support systems--Deep neural networks--Diagnosis--Diseases--Forecasting--Hospitals--Learning systems--Neural networks--Personal computing--Predictive analytics--Regression analysis--Statistical tests--Acute myocardial infarction--Area under the ROC curve--Cardiac event--Cardio-vascular disease--Different risk factors--Generalized linear model--Prediction model--Regression-based model--Deep learning;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85068840145

Whereas, Deep learning shows better results and performance with large amounts of data but it requires large computational power. Nowadays, computational power is not the limitation, hence deep learning is at its boost. The healthcare sector is using deep learning techniques for human disease classification, detection, or even predictions related to disease. Our research is also based upon the technique which is known as Decision Trees. The objective of our research is to predict the various outcomes of Myocardial Infarction (commonly known as a heart attack) using the Decision Trees but also using one more technique to improve the accuracy of prediction and this technique is known as Pruning. This is a type of Cardiovascular disease which affects the blood vessels as well as the heart. Cardiovascular diseases cause deaths in large numbers globally. Due to Cardiovascular diseases, nearly 17.9 million people died in 2019 in which heart attack and stroke were the main reasons for 85% of deaths. A heart attack which is also known as Myocardial Infarction causes damage to the heart muscles because of the decrease in the flow of blood or when the flow of blood completely stops to the coronary artery of the heart. © 2022 IEEE.;Cardiovascular Disease--Decision Tree--Myocardial Infarction--Neural Decision Tree--Pruning;Blood--Blood vessels--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Forecasting--Health care--Heart--Image processing--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Artificial intelligence learning--Cardiovascular disease--Computational power--Healthcare sectors--Heart attack--Large amounts of data--Myocardial Infarction--Neural decision tree--Performance--Pruning--Decision trees;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85152187332

Its noninvasive, continuous and accurate reconstruction and monitoring are essential to the evaluation, prevention and treatment of cardiovascular system diseases. However, it is difficult to improve the accuracy of noninvasive central arterial pressure reconstruction by traditional methods, which limits its clinical application and promotion. In this study, a model for reconstructing central artery pressure from radial arterial pressure waveforms based on a convolutional neural network and bi-directional long short-term memory (CNN-BiLSTM) was proposed. Central aortic pressure waveforms and radial arterial pressure waveforms were measured invasively before and after medication in 62 patients to evaluate the CNN-BiLSTM model for reconstructing central artery pressure. The CNN-BiLSTM model was compared with two traditional methods (autoregressive exogenous (ARX) and N-point moving average method (NPMA)) and four deep learning models (LSTM, BiLSTM, LSTM-BiLSTM and CNN-LSTM) in the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC). Experimental results showed that the proposed model achieved the best results on waveform reconstruction (MAE: 2.18 ± 0.13 mmHg, RMSE: 2.95 ± 0.16 mmHg). At the same time, a good reconstruction effect was obtained in the central arterial systolic pressure (RMSE: 3.34 ± 0.91 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (RMSE: 2.41 ± 0.18 mmHg). Therefore, the reconstruction model based on CNN-BILSTM is a potential method for noninvasive continuous monitoring of central arterial pressure. © 2022;Bi-directional long short-term memory--Cardiovascular diseases--Central arterial pressure--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Waveform reconstruction;Blood pressure--Brain--Cardiology--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Long short-term memory--Mean square error--Arterial pressures--Bi-directional--Bi-directional long short-term memory--Cardiovascular disease--Central arterial pressure--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Pressure waveforms--Root mean square errors--Waveform reconstruction--arterial pressure--artery reconstruction--Article--artificial neural network--blood pressure--cardiovascular disease--cardiovascular system--convolutional neural network--cross validation--data analysis--deep learning--diastolic blood pressure--human--machine learning--mathematical phenomena--mean arterial pressure--monitoring--physiology--pulse pressure--pulse wave--root mean squared error--sensitivity and specificity--short term memory--spectral domain optical coherence tomography--support vector machine--systolic blood pressure--telecommunication--training--waveform--Diseases;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85123858864

CAHD can be early detected through pre-symptomatic health check-ups, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) is common for non-invasive health check diagnoses. Traditionally, ECG signals are utilized to extract clinical features that are then input into machine learning methods for training and prediction. While these extracted features are interpretable, they are difficult to break through known features. On the other hand, ECG can be directly input to deep learning techniques, but such methods are usually limited by small sample sizes. Here, we propose to merge multiple beats of raw signal into one beat, which greatly reduces the complexity while maintaining the raw information. Moreover, we have constructed the largest benchmark dataset for 1113 CAHD patients of 12-lead ECG signals from the UK Biobank database and used the data to train a deep learning model. The results indicated that merged beat signals could achieve the best performance corresponding to an AUC of 0.71 and accuracy of 0.7, which is 4% higher than models using the raw signals and 6% higher than those using the clinical features. Further intuitive interpretation revealed that ST waves in lead II and V3 are the most closely associated with CAHD, consistent with clinical observations.  © 2022 IEEE.;Coronary atherosclerotic heart disease--Deep learning--Electrocardiogram--Merged beat--Residual network--XGBoost.;Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Heart--Lead compounds--Learning systems--Causes of death--Clinical features--Coronary atherosclerotic heart disease--Deep learning--Electrocardiogram signal--Heart disease--Merged beat--Raw signals--Residual network--Xgboost.--Electrocardiograms;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85146721439

This review summarizes and discusses the principles regarding nuclear cardiology techniques and AI, and the current evidence regarding its performance and contribution to the improvement of risk prediction in cardiovascular disease. Recent Findings and Summary: There is a growing body of evidence on the experimentation with and implementation of machine learning-based AI on nuclear cardiology studies both concerning SPECT and PET technology for the improvement of risk-of-disease (classification of disease) and risk-of-events (prediction of adverse events) estimations. These publications still report objective divergence in methods either utilizing statistical machine learning approaches or deep learning with varying architectures, dataset sizes, and performance. Recent efforts have been placed into bringing standardization and quality to the experimentation and application of machine learning-based AI in cardiovascular imaging to generate standards in data harmonization and analysis through AI. Machine learning-based AI offers the possibility to improve risk evaluation in cardiovascular disease through its implementation on cardiac nuclear studies.

In particular, the analysis of images using machine learning and computer vision is one of the most important domains in the area. The idea that machines can outperform the human eye in recognizing subtle patterns is not new, but it is now gaining momentum with large financial investments and the arrival of many startups with a focus in this area. Several examples illustrate that machine learning has enabled us to detect more diffuse patterns that are difficult to detect by non-experts. This chapter provides a state-of-the-art review of machine learning and computer vision in medical image analysis. We start with a brief introduction to computer vision and an overview of deep learning architectures. We proceed to highlight relevant progress in clinical development and translation across various medical specialties of dermatology, pathology, ophthalmology, radiology, and cardiology, focusing on the domains of computer vision and machine learning. Furthermore, we introduce some of the challenges that the disciplines of computer vision and machine learning face within a traditional regulatory environment. This chapter highlights the developments of computer vision and machine learning in medicine by displaying a breadth of powerful examples that give the reader an understanding of the potential impact and challenges that computer vision and machine learning can play in the clinical environment. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.;Artificial intelligence--Clinical data--Computer vision--Deep learning--Healthcare--Image analysis--Image recognition--Machine learning--Medical imaging--Radiology;;Springer Nature;;Book chapter;Scopus;2-s2.0-85151627765

The early and accurate diagnosis of diseases can help save many patients' lives. Cardiovascular disease can be detected using medical tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, heart sounds, and computed tomography (CT) images. Recognizing CD using ECG signals is essential compared to all the above tests. For the early detection of cardiac patients, many researchers analyzed the cardiovascular disease risk factors and employed machine learning or deep learning approaches. However, these models still need to be enhanced. In this study, we compared two models of CNN techniques which are LeNet-5 and ResNet-50 then the highest-performing model was selected. We proposed a modified version of the ResNet-50 model to improve the prediction of cardiovascular disease patients. The ECG data from the patients were taken into account as the crucial input for the CD classifier. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and specificity are used to compare the modified version to the original version. The obtained results showed that the performance of the ResNet-50 model was better than the LeNet-5 model. Modifying the ResNet-50 model's architecture improved the model's ability to analyze the ECGs dataset and extract its most significant features. According to the results, the modified ResNet-50 model based on the ECG image dataset increased the accuracy compared to the original ResNet-50 model by 4.83 percentage points. © 2022 IEEE.;Cardiovascular disease--CNNs--prediction--ResNet-50;Cardiology--Computerized tomography--Deep learning--Diseases--Forecasting--Medical imaging--Cardiac patients--Cardio-vascular disease risk factors--Cardiovascular disease--Computed tomography images--Diagnoses of disease--Electrocardiogram signal--Heart sounds--Learning approach--Machine-learning--Resnet-50--Electrocardiograms;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85169298699

The best way to address data-based decisions is through artificial intelligence techniques (AI), which haven't been systematize for MI detection. Thereby, we performed a systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42021229084). The literature search from Pubmed, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore and Embase resulted in n = 48 included articles. 71% of those articles implemented deep-learning models, while the other 29% developed machine-learning models, from which Convolutional Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines were the most common architectures. Data pre-processing methods, ECG-derived features with their corresponding feature extraction techniques, dimensionality reduction and redundancy evaluation algorithms and classifier are discussed in the present work. Furthermore, public and private datasets are analyzed, and class balance is addressed. To the extent of our knowledge, the present work is one of the most comprehensive reviews that addressed systematically the characteristics of artificial intelligence algorithms for the detection of MI based on ECG information. © 2022 IEEE.;Deep Learning--ECG--Machine Learning--Myocardial Infarction--Systematic Review;Cardiology--Convolutional neural networks--Data handling--Decision making--Deep learning--Learning systems--Support vector machines--Address datum--Artificial intelligence techniques--Automated detection--Clinical decision making--Deep learning--Intelligence models--Literature search--Machine-learning--Myocardial Infarction--Systematic Review--Electrocardiograms;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85147542567

When diagnosing and detecting heart disease, medical imaging can provide high-resolution scans of every organ or tissue in the heart. The diagnostic results obtained by the imaging method are less susceptible to human interference. They can process numerous patient information, assist doctors in early detection of heart disease, intervene and treat patients, and improve the understanding of heart disease symptoms and clinical diagnosis of great significance. In a computer-aided diagnosis system, accurate segmentation of cardiac scan images is the basis and premise of subsequent thoracic function analysis and 3D image reconstruction. Existing techniques: This paper systematically reviews automatic methods and some difficulties for cardiac segmentation in radiographic images. Combined with recent advanced deep learning techniques, the feasibility of using deep learning network models for image segmentation is discussed, and the commonly used deep learning frameworks are compared. Developed insights: There are many standard methods for medical image segmentation, such as traditional methods based on regions and edges and methods based on deep learning. Because of characteristics of non-uniform grayscale, individual differences, artifacts and noise of medical images, the above image segmentation methods have certain limitations. It is tough to obtain the needed results sensitivity and accuracy when performing heart segmentation. The deep learning model proposed has achieved good results in image segmentation. Accurate segmentation improves the accuracy of disease diagnosis and reduces subsequent irrelevant computations. There are two requirements for accurate segmentation of radiological images. One is to use image segmentation to improve the development of computer-aided diagnosis. The other is to achieve complete segmentation of the heart. When there are lesions or deformities in the heart, there will be some abnormalities in the radiographic images, and the segmentation algorithm needs to segment the heart altogether. The quantity of processing inside a certain range will no longer be a restriction for real-time detection with the advancement of deep learning and the enhancement of hardware device performance. © 2022;Cardiovascular image segmentation--Deep medicine--Heart disease--Medical image analysis;Deep Learning--Heart Diseases--Humans--Image Processing, Computer-Assisted--Imaging, Three-Dimensional--Radiography--Cardiology--Computer aided diagnosis--Deep learning--Diseases--Heart--Image analysis--Image enhancement--Image reconstruction--Medical imaging--Automatic segmentations--Cardiovascular image segmentation--Computer technology--Deep medicine--Heart disease--Images segmentations--Machine intelligence--Medical image analysis--Medical imaging technology--Radiographic images--autoencoder--cardiovascular disease--convolutional neural network--deep learning--diagnosis--feed forward neural network--gated recurrent unit network--heart disease--human--radiocardiography--recurrent neural network--Review--segmentation algorithm--systematic review--diagnostic imaging--heart disease--image processing--procedures--radiography--three-dimensional imaging--Image segmentation;Elsevier Ireland Ltd;35487181;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85129039945

This may delay or misdirect therapy. Objective: We hypothesized that deep learning (DL) can accurately classify AF from AT by revealing electrogram (EGM) signatures. Methods: We studied 86 patients in whom the diagnosis of AF or AT was established at electrophysiological study (25 female, 65 ± 11 years). Custom DL architectures were trained to identify AF using N = 29,340 unipolar and N = 23,760 bipolar EGM segments. We compared DL to traditional classifiers based on rate or regularity. We explained DL using computer models to assess the impact of controlled variations in shape, rate and timing on AF/AT classification in 246,067 EGMs reconstructed from clinical data. Results: DL identified AF with AUC of 0.97 ± 0.04 (unipolar) and 0.92 ± 0.09 (bipolar). Rule-based classifiers misclassified ∼10–12% of cases. DL classification was explained by regularity in EGM shape (13%) or timing (26%), and rate (60%--p < 0.001), and also by a set of unipolar EGM shapes that classified as AF independent of rate or regularity. Overall, the optimal AF ‘fingerprint’ comprised these specific EGM shapes, >15% timing variation, <0.48 correlation in beat-to-beat EGM shapes and CL < 190 ms (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Deep learning of intracardiac EGMs can identify AF or AT via signatures of rate, regularity in timing or shape, and specific EGM shapes. Future work should examine if these signatures differ between different clinical subpopulations with AF. © 2022 The Authors;Arrhythmia--Atrial fibrillation--Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Electrophysiology--Implanted devices--Machine learning--Wearables;Atrial Fibrillation--Computer Simulation--Deep Learning--Electrophysiologic Techniques, Cardiac--Female--Humans--Biomedical signal processing--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Electrophysiology--Wearable technology--antiarrhythmic agent--Atrial fibrillation--Automatic Detection--Biomedical signals processing--Bipolar electrograms--Electrograms--Electrophysiological studies--High rate--Implanted device--Intracardiac electrograms--Learning architectures--adult--aged--atrial fibrillation--bagged tree--classifier--clinical trial (topic)--cohort analysis--computer model--Conference Paper--convolutional neural network--cross validation--deep learning--diagnostic accuracy--diagnostic error--diagnostic test accuracy study--electrocardiogram--feature extraction--feature extraction algorithm--feature selection--female--heart electrophysiology--human--intermethod comparison--k nearest neighbor--linear regression analysis--machine learning--major clinical study--male--middle aged--predictive value--recurrent neural network--sensitivity and specificity--support vector machine--supraventricular tachycardia--atrial fibrillation--computer simulation--heart function test--Cardiology;Elsevier Ltd;35429831;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85127958661

In nuclear cardiology, there are many clinical, stress, and imaging variables potentially available, which need to be optimally integrated to predict the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) or predict the risk of cardiovascular events. In spite of clinical awareness of a large number of potential variables, it is difficult for physicians to integrate multiple features consistently and objectively. Machine learning (ML) is particularly well suited to integrating this vast array of information to provide patient-specific predictions. Deep learning (DL), a branch of ML characterized by a multi-layered convolutional model architecture, can extract information directly from images and identify latent image features associated with a specific prediction. This review will discuss the latest AI applications to disease diagnosis and risk prediction in nuclear cardiology with a focus on potential clinical applications. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.;;Artificial Intelligence--Cardiology--Deep Learning--Humans--Machine Learning--artificial intelligence--cardiology--deep learning--human--machine learning--nuclear medicine--Review--risk assessment--artificial intelligence;Springer;35508795;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85129606930

Ltd., Shanghai, 200050, China--Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200233, China;In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning architecture, referred as MCG-Net, integrating convolutional neural network (CNN) with transformer-based global context block for fine-grained delineation and diagnostic classification of four cardiac events from magnetocardiogram (MCG) data, namely Q-, R-, S- and T-waves. MCG-Net takes advantage of a multi-resolution CNN backbone as well as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) transformer encoders that facilitate global temporal feature aggregation. Besides the novel network architecture, we introduce a multi-task learning scheme to achieve simultaneous delineation and classification. Specifically, the problem of MCG delineation is formulated as multi-class heatmap regression. Meanwhile, a binary diagnostic classification label as well as a duration are jointly estimated for each cardiac event using features that are temporally aligned by event heatmaps. The framework is evaluated on a clinical MCG dataset, containing data collected from 270 subjects with cardiac anomalies and 108 control subjects. We designed and conducted a two-fold cross-validation study to validate the proposed method and to compare its performance with the SOTA methods. Experimental results demonstrated that our method outperformed counterparts on both event delineation and diagnostic classification tasks, achieving respectively an average ECG-F1 of 0.987 and an average Event-F1 of 0.975 for MCG delineation, and an average accuracy of 0.870, an average sensitivity of 0.732, an average specificity of 0.914 and an average AUC of 0.903 for diagnostic classification. Comprehensive ablation experiments are additionally performed to investigate effectiveness of different network components.  © 2013 IEEE.;Cardiac event delineation--Convolutional neural network--Diagnostic classification--Magnetocar diograph--Transformers;Arrhythmias, Cardiac--Humans--Neural Networks, Computer--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Network architecture--Cardiac event delineation--Convolutional neural network--Diagnostic classification--End to end--Fine grained--Heatmaps--Magnetocar diograph--Magnetocardiograms--Magnetocardiograph--Transformer--area under the curve--Article--artificial intelligence--artificial neural network--cardiovascular disease--clinical evaluation--cohort analysis--computed tomographic angiography--controlled study--convolutional neural network--coronary artery obstruction--cross validation--deep learning--diagnostic test accuracy study--electrocardiography--heart disease--human--image segmentation--machine learning--magnetocardiography--major adverse cardiac event--major clinical study--Q wave--QRS complex--R wave--receiver operating characteristic--S wave amplitude--sensitivity and specificity--T wave--thorax pain--validation process--validation study--heart arrhythmia--Heart;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;34780340;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85125964833

In the last three decades, India has experienced a 30% increase in incidences of BC’s where every nine minutes, a woman dies of BC. HD has become very common, and their early identification is crucial for clinicians to save lives and protect their patients. Early diagnosis of BC and HD are thus beneficial. MLT (Machine Learning Technique) have been used in medical diagnostics for detecting illnesses, minimizing modalities, and enhancing survival rates. Single classifier or Conventional classification algorithms exhibit a limited accuracy and affect the prediction outcome. Ensemble learning is a technique for producing many basic classifiers are those that are used to construct new classifiers created that outperforms any constituent classifier. In this work, EDL (Ensemble Deep Learning) classifier is estimated based on two classifiers, ECNN (Entropy Convolutional Neural Network) and DWBi-LSTM. These classifiers are applied to an imputed dataset of heart disease and breast cancer, with selected feature subsets. In the ECNN classifier, the weight of the Convolutional layers is computed via the entropy function. In the DWBi-LSTM classifier, divergence is used to assign the attentive weights of each feature to the classification.

The dynamic propagation of cardiac electrical signals are often described by electrophysiological models in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs), which are commonly solved by the finite element method (FEM). However, FEM-based simulation only provides the numerical solution of the PDEs and is incapable of incorporating real clinical measurements into the modeling for optimal decision making. Additionally, electrical signals from the heart are commonly collected through cardiac catheterization, which acquires cardiac signals from limited spatial locations. Such sparse sensor measurements significantly challenge traditional machine learning methods for reliable predictive modeling. This paper presents a physics-constrained deep active learning (P-DAL) framework to model spatiotemporal cardiac electrodynamics. Specifically, we adapt the physics-constrained deep learning (P-DL) framework developed in our prior work to integrate the physical laws of the cardiac electrical wave propagation with deep learning for robust predictive modeling of the heart electrical behavior from sparse sensor measurements. Furthermore, we develop a novel active learning strategy to seek the informative spatial locations on the heart surface for data collection to further increase the predictive power of the P-DL method. This active learning criterion combines both the prediction uncertainty of the P-DL and the space-filling design over the heart geometry. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework to model cardiac electrodynamics in both healthy and diseased heart systems. Numerical results show that the proposed P-DL approach significantly outperforms traditional modeling methods. Specifically, P-DL achieves up to 48.3% and 28.0% reduction in the estimated Relative Error (RE) compared with that from the traditional spatiotemporal Gaussian process (STGP) models in the healthy and diseased systems, respectively. We also demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed active learning procedure by comparing it with traditional learning strategies. Specifically, RE generated from the proposed P-DAL achieves 16.3% and 28.0% (11.1% and 21.2%) reduction compared with RE generated from the P-DL method based on pure space-filling design (i.e., P-DSL) and random data sampling strategy (P-DRL) in the healthy (diseased) heart system, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd;Active learning--Cardiac electrodynamics--Physics-constrained deep learning--Spatiotemporal Gaussian process;Computer Simulation--Heart--Machine Learning--Normal Distribution--Physics--Cardiology--Decision making--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Electrodynamics--Electrophysiology--Finite element method--Forecasting--Gaussian distribution--Gaussian noise (electronic)--Numerical methods--Active Learning--Cardiac electrodynamic--Electrical signal--Gaussian Processes--Physic-constrained deep learning--Predictive models--Relative errors--Sensor measurements--Spatial location--Spatiotemporal gaussian process--Article--cardiac electrodynamics--cell membrane potential--controlled study--deep learning--electric potential--finite element analysis--health physics--heart catheterization--heart cycle--human--k nearest neighbor--left ventricular apex--maximum likelihood method--measurement--medical electronics--noise--physics constrained deep active learning--predictive model--singular value decomposition--spatiotemporal analysis--stochastic model--computer simulation--heart--machine learning--normal distribution--physics--Heart;Elsevier Ltd;35751197;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85130936794

Recent advancement of machine learning (ML) application demonstrates that using electrocardiogram (ECG) and patients' data, detecting heart disease during the early stage is feasible. However, both ECG and patients' data are often imbalanced, which ultimately raises a challenge for the traditional ML to perform unbiasedly. Over the years, several data level and algorithm level solutions have been exposed by many researchers and practitioners. To provide a broader view of the existing literature, this study takes a systematic literature review (SLR) approach to uncover the challenges associated with imbalanced data in heart diseases predictions. Before that, we conducted a meta-analysis using 451 reference literature acquired from the reputed journals between 2012 and November 15, 2021. For in-depth analysis, 49 referenced literature has been considered and studied, taking into account the following factors: heart disease type, algorithms, applications, and solutions. Our SLR study revealed that the current approaches encounter various open problems/issues when dealing with imbalanced data, eventually hindering their practical applicability and functionality. In the diagnosis of heart disease, machine learning approaches help to improve data-driven decision-making. A metadata analysis of 451 articles and content analysis of 49 selected articles of heart disease diagnosis.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used tool for automatically detecting cardiac abnormalities, thereby helping to control and manage CVDs. To encourage more multidisciplinary researches, PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020 (Challenge 2020) provided a public platform involving multi-center databases and automatic evaluations for ECG classification tasks. As a result, 41 teams successfully submitted their solutions and were qualified for rankings. Although Challenge 2020 was a success, there has been no in-depth methodological meta-analysis of these solutions, making it difficult for researchers to benefit from the solutions and results. In this study, we aim to systematically review the 41 solutions in terms of data processing, feature engineering, model architecture, and training strategy. For each perspective, we visualize and statistically analyze the effectiveness of the common techniques, and discuss the methodological advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we summarize five practical lessons based on the aforementioned analysis: (1) Data augmentation should be employed and adapted to specific scenarios--(2) Combining different features can improve performance--(3) A hybrid design of different types of deep neural networks (DNNs) is better than using a single type--(4) The use of end-to-end architectures should depend on the task being solved--(5) Multiple models are better than one. We expect that our meta-analysis will help accelerate the research related to ECG classification based on machine-learning models.

During embryonic development, abnormal atrial septal development leads to pores between the left and right atria. ASD accounts for the largest proportion of congenital heart disease. Therefore, the design and implementation of an ASD intelligent auxiliary segmentation system based on deep learning segmentation of the atria has very important practical significance, which we aim to achieve in this paper. Methods: This study proposes a multi-scale dilated convolution module, which is composed of three parallel dilated convolutions with different expansion coefficients. The original FCN network usually adopts bilinear interpolation or deconvolution methods when upsampling, both of which lead to information loss to a certain extent. In order to make up for the loss of information, it is expected that the final segmentation result can be directly connected to the deep features in the cardiac MRI. This study uses a dense upsampling convolution module, and in order to obtain the shallow position information, the original FCN jump connection module is still retained. In this research, a deep convolutional neural network for multi-scale feature extraction is designed through the multi-scale expansion convolution module. At the same time, this paper also implements two traditional machine learning segmentation methods (K-means and Watershed algorithms) and a deep learning algorithm (U-net) for comparison. Results: The intelligent auxiliary segmentation algorithm for atrial images proposed in this framework based on multi-scale expansion convolution and adversarial learning can achieve superior results. Among them, the segmentation algorithm based on multi-scale expansion convolution can extract the associated features of pixels in multiple ranges, and can obtain deeper feature information when using a limited downsampling layer. According to the experimental results of the multi-scale expanded convolutional network on the data set, the Proportion of Greater Contour (PGC) index of the multi-scale expanded convolutional network is 98.78, the value of Average Perpendicular Distance (ADP) is 1.72mm, and the value of Overlapping Dice Metric (ODM) is 0.935, which are higher than other models. Conclusion: The experimental results show that compared with other segmentation models, the model based on multi-scale expansion convolution has significantly improved the accuracy of segmentation. Our technique will be able to assist in the segmentation of ASD, evaluation of the extent of the defect and enhance surgical planning via atrial septal occlusion. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.;Atrial Septal Defect--Cardiac MRI--Fully connected network--K-means segmentation--Multi-scale Dilated Convolution--Watershed segmentation;Dilatation--Heart Septal Defects, Atrial--Humans--Image Processing, Computer-Assisted--Magnetic Resonance Imaging--Neural Networks, Computer--Cardiology--Convolutional neural networks--Deconvolution--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Heart--Image segmentation--K-means clustering--Learning algorithms--Magnetic resonance imaging--Signal sampling--Watersheds--adenosine diphosphate--Atrial septal defect--Cardiac MRI--Congenital heart disease--Fully connected networks--K-means segmentations--Multi-scale dilated convolution--Multi-scales--Septal defect--Upsampling--Watershed segmentation--Article--cardiovascular magnetic resonance--comparative study--convolutional neural network--deconvolution--deep learning--feature extraction--heart atrium septum defect--image segmentation--k means clustering--segmentation algorithm--watershed algorithm--diagnostic imaging--dilatation--heart septum defect--human--image processing--nuclear magnetic resonance imaging--Convolution;Elsevier Ireland Ltd;35063713;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85122969906

Recent studies have revealedvarious facts for analyzing cardiac data by sensing, monitoring, and learning data in IoT to predict early diagnosis and treatment. Through machine learning based feature analysis, accurate disease detection has been implemented. However, the dominant methods do not accurately predict the result since the incorrect features contain non-relatedsupport values to select the features to perform training validation and produce prediction inaccuracy. To overcome this limitation, a Machine Learning and Transfer Learning Model (TLM) is proposed to perform heart disease prediction. Initially, pre-processing has been carried out to reduce dimension, and the scaling factor was also used to calculate the margin rate. To increasing the prediction accuracy Disease Prone Impact Rate (DPIR) intends to find the support values. To select the labeled features, Relative Feature Margin Selection (RFMS) is used to select and train the model by Multilayer perception neural network (MLPNN). This classifier selects the margin weights to predict the heart disease risk level based on the class. This predicts higher impact of cardiac deficiency rate by attaining the relevant features based deep feature data learning model, which produce higher precision rate to increase the prediction accuracy than other methods. © 2022 IEEE;feature selection and classification--heart disease prediction--machine learning and transfer learning--neural network;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Feature Selection--Heart--Learning systems--Multilayer neural networks--Transfer learning--Condition--Feature selection and classification--Heart disease--Heart disease prediction--Learning models--Machine learning and transfer learning--Machine-learning--Neural-networks--Prediction accuracy--Transfer learning--Forecasting;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85148330607

ECG signals are crucial in the early diagnosis of numerous cardiac diseases. Therefore, it is very important to read and analyze these signals using state-of-the-art technologies. The regular wave shapes in ECG data are frequently disturbed when certain heart diseases occur and these changes in signals help for detecting the disease. Signal processing and machine learning-based methods are widely used for this purpose. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have become widespread, and they offer promising results. This study aims to segmentation-based detection of R-peak locations in ECG signals. First, the ECG signal is transformed into a Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) based scalogram image, and then U-Net-based deep learning architectures are utilized for the segmentation. The comparisons are carried out on MIT -BIH Arrhythmia Database (MIT-DB).

Such methods are generally based on medical knowledge, either directly encoded with rules or automatically extracted from medical data using machine learning (ML). ML techniques, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs), are based on mathematical models with parameters that can be optimally tuned using appropriate algorithms. The ever-increasing compu-tational capacity of today’s computer systems enables more complex ML systems with millions of parameters, bringing AI closer to human intelligence. With this objective, the term deep learning (DL) has been introduced to characterize ML based on deep ANN (DNN) architectures with multiple layers of artificial neurons. Despite all of these promises, the impact of AI in current clinical practice is still limited. However, this could change shortly, as the significantly increased papers in AI, machine learning and deep learning in cardiology show. We highlight the significant achievements of recent years in nearly all areas of cardiology and underscore the mounting evidence suggesting how AI will take a central stage in the field. © 2022 by the authors.

Moreover, with the added influence of recent health factors, its incidence rate keeps showing an upward trend. Today, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can provide a full range of structural and functional information for the heart, and has become an important tool for the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease. Therefore, improving the image resolution of CMR has an important medical value for the diagnosis and condition assessment of heart disease. At present, most single-image super-resolution (SISR) reconstruction methods have some serious problems, such as insufficient feature information mining, difficulty to determine the dependence of each channel of feature map, and reconstruction error when reconstructing high-resolution image. Methods: To solve these problems, we have proposed and implemented a dual U-Net residual network (DURN) for super-resolution of CMR images. Specifically, we first propose a U-Net residual network (URN) model, which is divided into the up-branch and the down-branch. The up-branch is composed of residual blocks and up-blocks to extract and upsample deep features--the down-branch is composed of residual blocks and down-blocks to extract and downsample deep features. Based on the URN model, we employ this a dual U-Net residual network (DURN) model, which combines the extracted deep features of the same position between the first URN and the second URN through residual connection. It can make full use of the features extracted by the first URN to extract deeper features of low-resolution images. Results: When the scale factors are 2, 3, and 4, our DURN can obtain 37.86 dB, 33.96 dB, and 31.65 dB on the Set5 dataset, which shows (i) a maximum improvement of 4.17 dB, 3.55 dB, and 3.22dB over the Bicubic algorithm, and (ii) a minimum improvement of 0.34 dB, 0.14 dB, and 0.11 dB over the LapSRN algorithm. Conclusion: Comprehensive experimental study results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed DURN can not only achieve better performance for peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) values than other state-of-the-art SR image algorithms, but also reconstruct clearer super-resolution CMR images which have richer details, edges, and texture. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.;Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)--Residual connection--Single-image super-resolution (SISR)--Super-resolution--U-Net residual network (URN);Algorithms--Delayed Emergence from Anesthesia--Disease Progression--Heart Diseases--Humans--Image Processing, Computer-Assisted--Magnetic Resonance Imaging--Signal-To-Noise Ratio--Benchmarking--Cardiology--Data mining--Diseases--Heart--Image enhancement--Image reconstruction--Image resolution--Magnetic resonance--Magnetic resonance imaging--Magnetism--Medical imaging--Cardiac magnetic resonance--Cardiac magnetic resonance images--Heart disease--Image super resolutions--Residual connection--Single images--Single-image super-resolution--Superresolution--U-net residual network--algorithm--Article--cardiovascular magnetic resonance--dual u net residual network--feature extraction--human--image reconstruction--image segmentation--machine learning--delayed emergence from anesthesia--disease exacerbation--heart disease--image processing--nuclear magnetic resonance imaging--procedures--signal noise ratio--Diagnosis;Elsevier Ireland Ltd;35255374;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85125561109

According to the report of the WHO, approximately 1 crore 79 lakh people lost their lives due to cardiovascular disease in the year 2019. This death represents almost 32% of all deaths that occurred globally. And, of the 32% of deaths, 85% were caused solely by heart attacks and strokes. The best way to avoid these premature deaths is to detect cardiovascular disease as soon as possible. This survey explains how machine learning and deep learning can aid in the early detection of cardiovascular disease, allowing us to avoid many premature deaths.

It leaves a scope to explore improvement of performance metrics by fusion of learned representations from deep learning. In this study, we propose a novel, multiple kernel learning (MKL) for their fusion using deep embeddings transferred from pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed MKL, finds optimal kernel combination by maximizing the similarity with ideal kernel and minimizing the redundancy with other basis kernels. Experiments are performed on 960 PCG epochs collected from 40 CAD and 40 normal subjects. The transferred embeddings attain maximum subject-level accuracy of 89.25% with kappa of 0.7850. Later, their fusion with handcrafted features using the proposed MKL gives an accuracy of 91.19% and kappa 0.8238.

CVD represents one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is vital to accurately detect the existence of heart diseases to help to save the patient life and prescribe a suitable treatment. The current evolution in artificial intelligence plays an important role in helping physicians diagnose different diseases. In the present work, a hybrid framework for the detection of heart diseases using medical voice records is suggested. A framework that consists of four layers, namely “Segmentation” Layer, “Features Extraction” Layer, “Learning and Optimization” Layer, and “Export and Statistics” Layer is proposed. In the first layer, a novel segmentation technique based on the segmentation of variable durations and directions (i.e., forward and backward) is suggested. Using the proposed technique, 11 datasets with 14,416 numerical features are generated. The second layer is responsible for feature extraction. Numerical and graphical features are extracted from the resulting datasets. In the third layer, numerical features are passed to 5 different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, while graphical features are passed to 8 different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with transfer learning to select the most suitable configurations. Grid Search and Aquila Optimizer (AO) are used to optimize the hyperparameters of ML and CNN configurations, respectively. In the last layer, the output of the proposed hybrid framework is validated using different performance metrics. The best-reported metrics are (1) 100% accuracy using ML algorithms including Extra Tree Classifier (ETC) and Random Forest Classifier (RFC) and (2) 99.17% accuracy using CNN. © 2022, The Author(s).;Aquila optimizer (AO)--Convolutional neural network (CNN)--Deep learning (DL)--Heart disease--Machine learning (ML)--Metaheuristic optimization;Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Decision trees--Deep learning--Diseases--Extraction--Feature extraction--Heart--Multilayer neural networks--Optimization--Patient treatment--Aquila optimizer--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Heart disease--Machine learning--Metaheuristic optimization--Numerical features--Optimisations--Optimizers--Cardiology;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85129699010

Expertise and experience of medical professionals are required to care for heart failure patients. Machine Learning models can help with understanding symptoms of cardiac disease. However, manual feature engineering is challenging and requires expertise to select the appropriate technique. This study proposes a smart healthcare framework using the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and cloud technologies that improve heart failure patients’ survival prediction without considering manual feature engineering. The smart IoT-based framework monitors patients on the basis of real-time data and provides timely, effective, and quality healthcare services to heart failure patients. The proposed model also investigates deep learning models in classifying heart failure patients as alive or deceased. The framework employs IoT-based sensors to obtain signals and send them to the cloud web server for processing. These signals are further processed by deep learning models to determine the state of patients. Patients’ health records and processing results are shared with a medical professional who will provide emergency help if required. The dataset used in this study contains 13 features and was attained from the UCI repository known as Heart Failure Clinical Records. The experimental results revealed that the CNN model is superior to other deep learning and machine learning models with a 0.9289 accuracy value. © 2022 by the authors.

Many efforts in the field focus on achieving high accuracy, with confident, albeit sometimes wrong, classifiers. Such model over-confidence is especially dangerous in health-care setting. Leveraging the release of the new heart sound dataset as a part of PhysioNet 2022 challenge, we explored a novel murmur detection methodology using uncertainty-aware tandem learning. To separate unknown samples and detect heart sounds with murmur present, we developed two binary classifiers, under the assumption that training two models to solve simpler tasks could improve the overall sensitivity. First, we used a support vector machine for identification of unknown samples, followed by a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for prediction of murmur. In addition, we implemented uncertainty estimation in DNN using Monte Carlo dropouts for further eliminating any samples that should be labelled as unknown. Our team mobihealth achieved 63% and 69% sensitivity and specificity of murmur, scoring 0.467 (ranked 34th out of 40) and 11032 (ranked 25th out of 39) on the hidden validation set and 0.374 (ranked 40th out of 40) and 18754 (ranked 39th out of 39) on the hidden testing set during the challenge for murmur and outcome prediction tasks, respectively. © 2022 Creative Commons.;;Cardiology--Support vector machines--Binary classifiers--Heart sounds--High-accuracy--Identification of unknowns--PhysioNet--Sensitivity and specificity--Simple++--Support vectors machine--Uncertainty--Uncertainty estimation--Deep neural networks;IEEE Computer Society;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85152886080

CVD is the summation of disorders that affect the heart's ability to function. Every year, over 18 million people worldwide die as a result of heart disease. One in three deaths from cardiovascular disease in them is preventable, and heart attacks can be predicted months in advance by assessing the patient's risk factors. Obesity, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, and Glucose levels are some of the risk factors. The aim is to predict CVD based on risk factors of patients, who are affected by their habits and patients' basic health information, using the Cardiovascular Disease Dataset from Kaggle using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms. Smoking and Alcohol consumption are some practices that will maximize the possibility of getting cardiovascular disorders, and doing workouts will reduce the risk of getting cardiovascular disease. In our work, we have implemented four models for predicting CVD namely Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Deep Learning Model and Random Forest.

An automated diagnostic tool is required to detect significant episodes in long-term ECG records. It is a very challenging task for cardiologists to analyze long-term ECG records in a short time. Therefore, a computer-based diagnosis tool is required to identify crucial episodes. Myocardial infarction (MI) and conduction disorders (CDs), sometimes known as heart blocks, are medical diseases that occur when a coronary artery becomes fully or suddenly stopped or when blood flow in these arteries slows dramatically. As a result, several researchers have utilized deep learning methods for MI and CD detection. However, there are one or more of the following challenges when using deep learning algorithms: (i) struggles with real-life data, (ii) the time after the training phase also requires high processing power, (iii) they are very computationally expensive, requiring large amounts of memory and computational resources, and it is not easy to transfer them to other problems, (iv) they are hard to describe and are not completely understood (black box), and (v) most of the literature is based on the MIT-BIH or PTB databases, which do not cover most of the crucial arrhythmias. This paper proposes a new deep learning approach based on machine learning for detecting MI and CDs using large PTB-XL ECG data. First, all challenging issues of these heart signals have been considered, as the signal data are from different datasets and the data are filtered. After that, the MI and CD signals are fed to the deep learning model to extract the deep features. In addition, a new custom activation function is proposed, which has fast convergence to the regular activation functions. Later, these features are fed to an external classifier, such as a support vector machine (SVM), for detection. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by the experimental findings, which show that it improves satisfactorily with an overall accuracy of 99.20% when using a CNN for extracting the features with an SVM classifier. © 2022 by the authors.;CNN--conduction disorders--deep learning--feature selection--myocardial infarction--SVM;Cardiology--Chemical activation--Classification (of information)--Deep learning--Feature Selection--Heart--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Support vector machines--Activation functions--Automated detection--Automated diagnostics--Condition--Conduction disorder--Deep learning--Features selection--Learning models--Myocardial Infarction--Support vectors machine--Electrocardiograms;MDPI;36080960;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85137572068

In the discipline of cardiac electrophysiology (EP), a number of clinical, imaging, and electrical waveform data are considered in the diagnosis, prognostication, and management of arrhythmias, which lend themselves well to automation through AI. But equally relevant, AI offers a unique opportunity to discover novel EP concepts and improve clinical care through its inherent, hierarchical tenets of self-learning. In this review we focus on the application of AI in clinical EP and summarize state-of-the art, large, clinical studies in the following key domains: (1) electrocardiogram-based arrhythmia and disease classification--(2) atrial fibrillation source detection--(3) substrate and risk assessment for atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias--and (4) predicting outcomes after cardiac resynchronization therapy. Many are small, single-centre, proof-of-concept investigations, but they still show ground-breaking performance of deep learning, a subdomain of AI, which surpasses traditional statistical analysis. Larger studies, for instance classifying arrhythmias from electrocardiogram recordings, have further provided external validation of their high accuracy. Ultimately, the performance of AI is dependent on the quality of the input data and the rigour of algorithm development. The field is still nascent and several barriers will need to be overcome, including prospective validation in large, well labelled data sets and more seamless information technology-based data collection/integration, before AI can be adopted into broader clinical EP practice.

In recent years, the incidence and mortality of coronary heart disease have increased rapidly. The quantification of the coronary artery is critical in diagnosing coronary heart disease. Methods: In this paper, we improve the coronary arteries segmentation performance from two aspects of network model and algorithm. We proposed a U-shaped network based on spatio-temporal feature fusion structure to segment coronary arteries from 2D slices of computed tomography angiography (CTA) heart images. The spatio-temporal feature combines features of multiple levels and different receptive fields separately to get more precise boundaries. It is easy to cause over-segmented for the small proportion of coronary arteries in CTA images. For this reason, a combo loss function was designed to deal with the notorious imbalance between inputs and outputs that plague learning models. Input imbalance refers to the class imbalance in the input training samples. The output imbalance refers to the imbalance between the false positive and false negative of the inference model. The two imbalances in training and inference were divided and conquered with our combo loss function. Specifically, a gradient harmonizing mechanism (GHM) loss was employed to balance the gradient contribution of the input samples and at the same time punish false positives/negatives using another sensitivity–precision loss term to learn better model parameters gradually. Results: Compared with some existing methods, our proposed method improves the segmentation accuracy significantly, achieving the mean Dice coefficient of 0.87. In addition, accurate results can be obtained with little data using our method. Code is available at: https://github.com/Ariel97-star/FFNet-CoronaryArtery-Segmentation. Conclusions: Our method can intelligently capture coronary artery structure and achieve accurate flow reserve fraction (FFR) analysis. Through a series of steps such as CPR curved reconstruction, the detection of coronary heart disease can be achieved without affecting the patient’s body. In addition, our work can be used as an effective means to assist in the detection of stenosis. In the screening of coronary heart disease among high-risk cardiovascular factors, automatic detection of luminal stenosis can be performed based on the application of later algorithm transformation. © 2021, Biomedical Engineering Society.;Combo loss function--Coronary CTA image segmentation--Deep learning--Feature fusion network;Algorithms--Computed Tomography Angiography--Constriction, Pathologic--Coronary Vessels--Humans--Image Processing, Computer-Assisted--Tomography, X-Ray Computed--Cardiology--Computerized tomography--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Heart--Image fusion--Angiography images--Combo loss function--Computed tomography angiography--Coronary arteries--Coronary computed tomography angiography image segmentation--Deep learning--Feature fusion network--Features fusions--Images segmentations--Loss functions--Article--artificial neural network--body weight loss--computed tomographic angiography--computer simulation--coronary artery disease--data mining--deep learning--false positive result--genetic algorithm--heart rate--human--image segmentation--intellectual impairment--intensive care unit--kernel method--prediction--receptive field--sleep disorder--spatiotemporal analysis--support vector machine--training--visual field--algorithm--computed tomographic angiography--coronary blood vessel--diagnostic imaging--image processing--procedures--stenosis, occlusion and obstruction--x-ray computed tomography--Image segmentation;Springer;34734373;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85118497064

Prediction of this disease has become a critical task in the field of medical analysis. As there is a significant improvement in the health industry but early prediction is necessary rather than making it worse and it's important to identify at the earlier stages. Recent studies reflect the use of hybrid approaches subjected to machine learning and deep learning techniques based on sensing technology in numerous applications, mainly involving complex tasks such as the collection of patient data and transforming them into Electronic Health Records (EHR). In this paper, we present a ranking-based intelligent feature selection method for identifying the optimal set of features for developing an adoptive model. The predictive classifier used to construct the model is a clustering-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the prediction of heart disease.  © 2022 IEEE.;Cardiovascular Disease--Clustering--Data Mining--Feature Selection--Machine Learning--SVM;Cardiology--Data mining--Deep learning--Diseases--Feature Selection--Forecasting--Hospital data processing--Learning systems--Metadata--Cardiovascular disease--Clusterings--Critical tasks--Features selection--Heart disease--Machine learning approaches--Machine-learning--Medical analysis--Prediction modelling--Support vectors machine--Support vector machines;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85150275091

In current clinical practice, clinical deterioration is detected, in most of the cases, when it has already occurred. Several early warning scores (EWS) have been proposed to assess children at risk of clinical deterioration using vital signs and risk indicators, in order to intervene in a timely manner to reduce the impact of deterioration and risk of death among children. However, EWS are based on measurements performed at a single time point without incorporating trends nor providing information about patient's risk trajectory. Moreover, some of these measurements rely on subjective assessment making them susceptible to different interpretations. All these limitations could explain why the implementation of EWS in high-resource settings failed to show a significant decrease in hospital mortality. By means of machine learning (ML) based algorithms we could integrate heterogeneous and complex data to predict patient's risk of deterioration. In this perspective article, we provide a brief overview of the potential of ML technologies to improve the identification of pediatric CHD patients at high-risk for clinical deterioration after cardiac surgery, and present the CORTEX traffic light, a ML-based predictive system that Sant Joan de Déu Barcelona Children's Hospital is implementing, as an illustration of the application of an ML-based risk stratification system in a relevant hospital setting.

Every ECG beat was converted into a two-dimensional grayscale image and utilized as the CNN classifier's input. The suggested CNN classifier is optimized using a wide range of deep learning techniques, including as batch normalization, data augmentation, Xavier initialization, and dropout. Along with comparing our proposed classifier to well-known machine learning methods like ID-CNN, SVM, RNN, FFNN, and others, we also looked at alternative classifiers. The MIT BIH arrhythmia database's ECG records were used for the classifier assessment. Our classifier had an average accuracy of 98.10% on the test set as a consequence. Each ECG recording served as test data for 10-fold cross-validation, which was used at the assessment to precisely verify our CNN classifier. Our experimental findings utilising the updated ECG images and the recommended CNN classifier have successfully confirmed the claim that high classification accuracy may be obtained without manually preprocessing the ECG signals with noise filtering, feature extraction, or feature reduction.  © 2022 IEEE.;Arrthymia--CNN--ECG--Feature extraction--Heart disease classification--K-fold cross validation--Machine Learning;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Deep learning--Diseases--Extraction--Feature extraction--Learning systems--Support vector machines--Arrthymia--Disease classification--ECG beats--Features extraction--Heart disease--Heart disease classification--K fold cross validations--Machine-learning--Performance--Two-dimensional--Electrocardiograms;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85151938927

Early detection of atherosclerotic lesions can help clinicians understand the condition of cardiovascular patients and provide reference for better treatment measures. Compared with other detection technologies, intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) has the advantages of no radiation, high resolution, and high imaging speed. Therefore, it plays an important role in the detection and evaluation of atherosclerotic plaque. Although IVOCT has been widely used in the detection of plaque in coronary vessels, the imaging system could not directly provide effective plaque feature identification information, and clinicians can only judge the characteristics of plaque according to their own experience. Based on a brief introduction of the application of IVOCT in detecting coronary atherosclerotic plaque, this paper introduces the method of eliminating the vascular motion artifact caused by cardiac pulsation. The automatic segmentation and classification of IVOCT images are studied by using machine learning method. And the plaque features of calcified plaque, lipid plaque and fibrous plaque in IVOCT images are extracted. The deep learning algorithm is used to analyze the characteristics of vulnerable plaque and put forward quantitative evaluation indicators. It is very important to develop the intelligent recognition system of IVOCT in plaque type, that provide objective, intuitive and accurate plaque classification marks, display and rupture risk assessment for the clinic. So that clinicians can get rid of the current situation of relying solely on experience for lesion recognition, and save patients' lives in time. © 2022 SPIE.;atherosclerotic plaque--automatic segmentation and classification--intelligent recognition system--intravascular optical coherence tomography--machine learning--risk assessment;Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Heart--Image segmentation--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Patient treatment--Risk assessment--Atherosclerotic plaque--Automatic classification--Automatic segmentations--Intelligent recognition--Intelligent recognition system--Intravascular--Intravascular optical coherence tomography--Machine-learning--Recognition systems--Risks assessments--Optical tomography;SPIE;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85146650520

Auscultation is a readily available screening tool for AS. However, it requires a high level of professional expertise. Hypothesis: An AI algorithm can detect AS using audio files with the same accuracy as experienced cardiologists. Methods: A deep neural network (DNN) was trained by preprocessed audio files of 100 patients with AS and 100 controls. The DNN's performance was evaluated with a test data set of 40 patients. The primary outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. Results of the DNN were compared with the performance of cardiologists, residents, and medical students. Results: Eighteen percent of patients without AS and 22% of patients with AS showed an additional moderate or severe mitral regurgitation. The DNN showed a sensitivity of 0.90 (0.81–0.99), a specificity of 1, and an F1-score of 0.95 (0.89–1.0) for the detection of AS. In comparison, we calculated an F1-score of 0.94 (0.86–1.0) for cardiologists, 0.88 (0.78–0.98) for residents, and 0.88 (0.78–0.98) for students. Conclusions: The present study shows that deep learning-guided auscultation predicts significant AS with similar accuracy as cardiologists. The results of this pilot study suggest that AI-assisted auscultation may help general practitioners without special cardiology training in daily practice. © 2022 The Authors.

Heart sounds can reflect detrimental changes in cardiac mechanical activity that are common pathological characteristics of chronic heart failure (CHF). The ACC/AHA heart failure (HF) stage classification is essential for clinical decision-making and the management of CHF. Herein, a machine learning model that makes use of multi-scale and multi-domain heart sound features was proposed to provide an objective aid for ACC/AHA HF stage classification. Approach. A dataset containing phonocardiogram (PCG) signals from 275 subjects was obtained from two medical institutions and used in this study. Complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition and tunable-Q wavelet transform were used to construct self-adaptive sub-sequences and multi-level sub-band signals for PCG signals. Time-domain, frequency-domain and nonlinear feature extraction were then applied to the original PCG signal, heart sound sub-sequences and sub-band signals to construct multi-scale and multi-domain heart sound features. The features selected via the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were fed into a machine learning classifier for ACC/AHA HF stage classification. Finally, mainstream machine learning classifiers, including least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), deep belief network (DBN) and random forest (RF), were compared to determine the optimal model. Main results. The results showed that the LS-SVM, which utilized a combination of multi-scale and multi-domain features, achieved better classification performance than the DBN and RF using multi-scale or/and multi-domain features alone or together, with average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.821, 0.955 and 0.820 on the testing set, respectively. Significance. PCG signal analysis provides efficient measurement information regarding CHF severity and is a promising noninvasive method for ACC/AHA HF stage classification.  © 2022 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.;ACC/AHA heart failure stages--chronic heart failure--classification--heart sounds;Algorithms--Heart Failure--Heart Sounds--Humans--Machine Learning--Phonocardiography--Support Vector Machine--Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Decision trees--Deep learning--Feature extraction--Frequency domain analysis--Heart--Noninvasive medical procedures--Support vector machines--Time domain analysis--Wavelet decomposition--ACC/AHA heart failure stage--Chronic heart failures--Heart failure--Heart sounds--Machine learning models--Multi-domains--Multi-scales--Phonocardiograms--Scale domains--Subbands--algorithm--heart failure--heart sound--human--machine learning--phonocardiography--support vector machine--Classification (of information);Institute of Physics;35512699;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85133214253

Within the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2021, we focused on the design of a machine learning algorithm to identify cardiac abnormalities from electrocardiogram recordings (ECGs) with a various number of leads and to assess the diagnostic potential of reduced-lead ECGs compared to standard 12-lead ECGs. Approach. In our solution, we developed a model based on a deep convolutional neural network, which is a 1D variant of the popular ResNet50 network. This base model was pre-trained on a large training set with our proposed mapping of original labels to SNOMED codes, using three-valued labels. In the next phase, the model was fine-tuned for the Challenge metric and conditions. Main results. In the Challenge, our proposed approach (team CeZIS) achieved a Challenge test score of 0.52 for all lead configurations, placing us 5th out of 39 in the official ranking. Our improved post-Challenge solution was evaluated as the best for all ranked configurations, i.e. for 12-lead, 3-lead, and 2-lead versions of the full test set with the Challenge test score of 0.62, 0.61, and 0.59, respectively. Significance. In addition to building the model for identifying cardiac anomalies, we provide a more detailed description of the issues associated with label mapping and propose its modification in order to obtain a better starting point for training more powerful classification models. We compare the performance of models for different numbers of leads and identify labels for which two leads are sufficient. Moreover, we evaluate the label quality in individual parts of the Challenge training set.  © 2022 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.;deep neural network--ECG signal--multi-label classification;Algorithms--Electrocardiography--Machine Learning--Neural Networks, Computer--Classification (of information)--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Electrocardiography--Learning algorithms--Mapping--Quality control--Challenge tests--Diagnostic potential--Electrocardiogram recording signal--Electrocardiogram recordings--Machine learning algorithms--Model-based OPC--Multi-label classifications--PhysioNet--Training data--Training sets--algorithm--electrocardiography--machine learning--procedures--Deep neural networks;Institute of Physics;35453131;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85133214650

The recent research have various fact for analyzing the cardiac data based on sensing, monitoring, learning data in IoT to predict the early diagnosing treatment. By accurate detection of disease detection in artificial intelligence are carried out through machine learning feature analysis. But predominant methods doesn't predict the result accurately because the improper features contain non-related support values to choose the features to the training validation produce prediction inaccuracy. To resolve this problem, we propose a Machine Learning and Transfer learning Model for predicting heart disease. Initially the preprocessing was carried out to reduce dimension and conjugant scaling factor was applied to find the margin rate. To increasing the prediction accuracy Disease prone impact rate (DPIR) intents to find the support values.

In cardiology, ECG is widely used to detect different cardiovascular diseases among which arrhythmias are the most common. Irregular heart cycles are collectively known as arrhythmias and may produce sudden cardiac arrest. Many times, arrhythmia evolves over an extended period. Hence, it requires an artificial-intelligence-enabled continuous ECG monitoring system that can detect irregular heart cycles automatically. In this regard, this chapter presents a methodological analysis of machine-learning and deep-learning-based arrhythmia detection techniques. Focusing on the state of the art, a deep-learning-based technique is implemented which recognizes normal heartbeat and seven different classes of arrhythmias. This technique uses a convolutional neural network as a classification tool. The performance of this technique is evaluated using ECG records of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. This technique performs well in terms of different classification metrics. © 2022, IGI Global. All rights reserved.;;;IGI Global;;Book chapter;Scopus;2-s2.0-85136873774

However, these metrics neglect more subtle and localized shape differences in 3D cardiac anatomy and function, which limit predictive accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel geometric deep learning approach to directly predict MACE outcomes within 1 year after the infarction event from high-resolution 3D cardiac anatomy meshes. Its architecture is specifically designed for direct and efficient processing of surface mesh data with a hierarchical, multi-scale structure to enable both local and global feature learning. We evaluate the binary MACE prediction capabilities of the proposed mesh classification network on a multi-center dataset of post-MI patients. Our results show that the proposed method outperforms corresponding clinical benchmarks by ∼ 16% and ∼ 6% in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for 3D shape and 3D contraction inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we visually analyze both 3D cardiac shapes and 3D contraction patterns with regards to their MACE predictability and demonstrate how task-specific information learned by the network on a balanced dataset successfully generalizes to increasing levels of class imbalance. Finally, we compare our approach to both clinical and machine learning benchmarks on our original highly-imbalanced dataset of post-MI patients and find average improvements in AUROC scores of ∼ 9% and ∼ 3%, respectively. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;3D cardiac contraction--3D cardiac shape--Cardiac MRI--Geometric deep learning--Graph neural networks--Major adverse cardiac event prediction--Mesh pooling--Post-myocardial infarction;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Forecasting--Heart--Medical imaging--Mesh generation--MESH networking--3d cardiac contraction--3d cardiac shape--Cardiac contraction--Cardiac MRI--Event prediction--Geometric deep learning--Graph neural networks--Major adverse cardiac event prediction--Mesh pooling--Myocardial Infarction--Post-myocardial infarction--Deep learning;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85148034771

However, variability in CTG interpretations affects intervention timings. Machine learning (ML) has been applied to this problem and has succeeded. We proposed to use a 5-minute Apgar score as the benchmark for hypoxia in our ML algorithms as it has shown a high correlation with abnormal CTG and better clinical support decision-making than pH umbilical cord blood. We used the CTU-UHB database containing 552 CTGs. We trained and compared five algorithms of decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) and artificial neural network (ANN). Performances were evaluated using precision, recall, F1 score and AUROC. The ANN with four deep layers had the highest recall (100%), while the RF classifier had the highest F1 (97%), AUROC (99.73%) and precision (97%) (Table 1). The longest deceleration length is the most important feature among the 21 features. Apgar scores can be used as a surrogate hypoxia marker for classifying CTG, making the model results more informative for clinical decision-making. © 2022 Creative Commons.;;Cardiology--Decision trees--Nearest neighbor search--Support vector machines--Decisions makings--F1 scores--Foetal heart rates--Machine learning algorithms--Machine-learning--Performance--Random forests--Support vectors machine--Umbilical cord blood--Uterine contraction--Neural networks;IEEE Computer Society;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85152926198

Encouraged by the variety and vast amount of data that can be gathered from patients (e.g., medical images, text, and electronic health records), researchers have recently increased their interest in developing AI solutions for clinical care. Moreover, a diverse repertoire of methods can be chosen towards creating performant models for use in medical applications, ranging from disease prediction, diagnosis, and prognosis to opting for the most appropriate treatment for an individual patient. In this respect, the present paper aims to review the advancements reported at the convergence of AI and clinical care.

We seek to classify OSAS and depression in OSAS patients, as well as sleep stages using multiple machine learning techniques. We have extracted features from 5-minute intervals of electrocardiograms (ECG), breathing signals, and electroen-cephalograms (EEG) recorded from a total of 118 subjects, of which 89 are used for training and 10-fold cross-validation and 29 are used for testing or a 75/25% split. The best classification performance of OSAS was obtained with light sleep and deep sleep with ReliefF using random forest and boosted trees, respectively. It has yielded an accuracy of 100.00%, F1-Score of 100.00%, Cohen's k Coefficient of 1.00, and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 1.00. All sleep stages with 10 principal components using random forest yielded an accuracy of 77.50%, F1-Score of 78.05%, Cohen's k of 0.571, and an MCC of 0.632 for classification of depression in OSAS patients. Sleep staging was best done using bagged trees with features selected via sequential backward feature selection, yielding an accuracy of 76.90%, F1-Score of 75.90%, Cohen's k of 0.480, and an MCC of 0.634. These results show promise in detecting OSAS and depression in OSAS patients, particularly using light and deep sleep data. © 2022 Creative Commons.;;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Computer aided diagnosis--Computer aided instruction--Forestry--Learning systems--Machine learning--Random forests--Sleep research--Breathing signals--Cephalograms--Computer aided detection--Condition--Correlation coefficient--F1 scores--Machine-learning--Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome--Random forests--Sleep stage--Electrocardiograms;IEEE Computer Society;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85152940305

It's still difficult because of its manual approach and the fact that only experienced healthcare practitioners can use it to diagnose anomalies. The automatic extraction of heart sound features to aid in classification has been explored, however there is still potential for improvement.

Through novel machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, AI has made significant grounds in cardiology and cardiac investigations, including echocardiography. Echocardiography is a ubiquitous tool that remains first-line for the evaluation of many cardiovascular diseases, with large data sets, objective parameters, widespread availability and an excellent safety profile, it represents the perfect candidate for AI advancement. As such, AI has firmly made its stamp on echocardiography, showing great promise in training, image acquisition, interpretation and analysis, diagnostics, prognostication and phenotype development. However, there remain significant barriers in real-world clinical application and uptake of AI derived algorithms in echocardiography, most importantly being the lack of clinical outcome studies. While AI has been shown to match or even best its human counterparts, an improvement in real world outcomes remains to be established. There are also legal and ethical concerns that hinder its progress. Large outcome focused trials and a collaborative multi-disciplinary effort will be necessary to push AI into the clinical workspace. Despite this, current and emerging trials suggest that these systems will undoubtedly transform echocardiography, improving clinical utility, efficiency and training.

However, making accurate estimates of LOS can be difficult for medical patients. This review was conducted with the aim of identifying and assessing previous studies on the application of machine learning to the prediction of total hospital inpatient LOS for medical patients. A review of machine learning in the prediction of total hospital LOS for medical inpatients was conducted using the databases PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science. Of the 673 publications returned by the initial search, 21 articles met inclusion criteria. Of these articles the most commonly represented medical specialty was cardiology. Studies were also identified that had specifically evaluated machine learning LOS prediction in patients with diabetes and tuberculosis. The performance of the machine learning models in the identified studies varied significantly depending on factors including differing input datasets and different LOS thresholds and outcome metrics. Common methodological shortcomings included a lack of reporting of patient demographics and lack of reporting of clinical details of included patients. The variable performance reported by the studies identified in this review supports the need for further research of the utility of machine learning in the prediction of total inpatient LOS in medical patients. Future studies should follow and report a more standardised methodology to better assess performance and to allow replication and validation. In particular, prospective validation studies and studies assessing the clinical impact of such machine learning models would be beneficial. © 2020 Royal Australasian College of Physicians;artificial intelligence--deep learning--neural network--predictive analytics;Databases, Factual--Forecasting--Humans--Inpatients--Length of Stay--Machine Learning--factual database--forecasting--hospital patient--human--length of stay--machine learning;John Wiley and Sons Inc;33094899;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85111487620

Accurate analysis and prediction for real-time heart disease are highly significant. To address this challenge, a novel IoT-based automated function monitoring system to promote the e-healthcare system is proposed. The proposed remote healthcare monitoring system uses an IoT framework (RHMIoT) using deep learning and auto encoder-based machine learning algorithms to accurately predict the presence of heart disease. The RHMIoT framework contains two phases: the first phase is to monitor the severity level of the heart disease patient in real-time, and the second phase is used in the medical decision support system to predict the accuracy level of heart disease. To train and test the open-access Framingham dataset, various deep learning and auto encoder-based machine learning techniques are used. The proposed system obtains an accuracy of 0.8714% using the auto encoder-based kernel SVM algorithm compared to other approaches.

The same network architecture is tested on another ECG dataset of arrhythmia patients to assess the generalizability of our DL model for ECG datasets, yielding an accuracy of 95.8% and an AUC of 99.46%, which is competitive in performance to the state-of-the-art models. Finally, we analyzed the ECG data using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) on the trained ST-CNN-GAP-5 to assess the explainability or interpretability of the decisions of this deep convolution network model. Results indicate that the model is able to highlight relevant alterations of the ECG waves as required by clinicians, making it explainable for diagnostic purposes. Deployment of such models can help in easing the burden on medical infrastructure in low- and middle-income populous countries. © 2022;CNN--Deep Learning--ECG Waves--Electrocardiogram--Interpretability--Residual Networks--SHAP--XAI;Cardiology--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Heart--Network architecture--Cardiac disorders--CNN--Deep learning--Electrocardiogram wave--Interpretability--Residual network--Shapley--Shapley additive explanation--State of the art--XAI--accuracy--aged--Article--artificial intelligence--cardiovascular disease--child--convolutional neural network--deep learning--deep neural network--electrocardiogram--feature extraction--female--Fourier transform--heart arrhythmia--heart disease--heart infarction--human--machine learning--major clinical study--male--signal processing--Stockwell transform--very elderly--Electrocardiography;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85126143087

Methods This study retrospectively included 595 patients suspected of coronary heart disease who received coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) or invasive coronary angiography (no coronary artery therapy has been performed in the past, coronary CTA examination was completed after admission followed by coronary angiography, and the interval was no more than 14 days) during hospitalization from December 2017 to December 2020. From these patients, a total of 1004 diseased blood vessels have been studied. Subsequent 3D-QCA was completed, followed by CT-FFR calculations, and the correlation analysis of the relevant parameters was carried out. According to the CT-FFR value, the patients were divided into non-functional lesion group with CT-FFR > 0.80 (n = 633) and functional lesion group with CT-FFR≤0.80 (n = 371). The diseased vessels included 443 anterior descending (LAD), 283 left circumflex (LCX), and 278 right coronary (RCA) vessels. ROC curves were drawn to analyze the sensitivity and specificity of 3D-QCA parameters for predicting non-functional lesions. Outcome Statistical analysis confirms that the differences in coronary artery diameter stenosis rate [(28.83±13.25)% and (39.29±15.39)%, P<0.001], cross-sectional area stenosis rate [(47.75±17.64)% and (60.89±17.12)%, P<0.001], volume stenosis rate [(22.20±8.85) % and (29.73±8.66) %, P＜0.001] of non-functional lesion group and functional lesion group were significant. While above parameters was found to be negatively correlated with CT-FFR values (the correlation coefficients were r=-0.359, P<0.001, r=-0.361, P<0.001, r=-0.382, P<0.001), coronary artery stenosis diameter [(1.75 ± 0.50) mm vs (0.83 ± 0.39) mm, P＜0.001], stenosis cross-sectional area [(2.59 ± 1.45) mm^2 vs (1.58 ± 1.11) mm^2, P <0.001], plaque volume [(39.95±26.24) mm^3 vs. (45.86±27.73) mm^3, P<0.001] were found to be positively correlated with the CT-FFR value with statistical significance (the correlation coefficients were r = 0.433, P < 0.001, r = 0.413, P < 0.001, r = -0.076, P = 0.016). The stenosis diameter greater than 1.455mm predicted non-functional ischemia with a sensitivity of 71.7% and a specificity of 64.2%. The stenosis cross-sectional area greater than 1.585 mm^2 predicted nonfunctional ischemia with a sensitivity of 73.5% and a specificity of 60.1% Conclusions There is a specific correlation between the diameter stenosis rate, area stenosis rate, and volume stenosis rate of coronary artery in the relevant parameters of quantitative analysis of three-dimensional coronary angiography and CTFFR value. However, the sensitivity and specificity of predicting whether the lesions are myocardial ischemia-related lesions are not high. Besides, since CT-FFR has certain characteristics in the functional evaluation of related diseased blood vessels, we recommended popularizing and promoting CT-FFR measurement technology for patients with suspected coronary heart disease before coronary angiography. © 2022 SPIE.

It is one of the most expensive diseases due to frequent hospitalizations and emergency room visits. Reducing unnecessary rehospitalizations is also an important and challenging task that has the potential of saving healthcare costs, enabling discharge planning, and identifying patients at high risk. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning-based prediction model of heart failure rehospitalization during 6, 12, 24-month follow-ups after hospital discharge in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We used the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction-National Institutes of Health (KAMIR-NIH) registry which included 13,104 patient records and 551 features. The proposed deep learning-based rehospitalization prediction model outperformed traditional machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machine, AdaBoost, gradient boosting machine, and random forest. The performance of the proposed model was accuracy, the area under the curve, precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score of 99.37%, 99.90%, 96.86%, 98.61%, 99.49%, and 97.73%, respectively. This study showed the potential of a deep learning-based model for cardiology, which can be used for decision-making and medical diagnosis tool of heart failure rehospitalization in patients with AMI. © The Author(s) 2022.;acute myocardial infarction--decision support system--heart failure--hospital readmission--medical diagnosis--rehospitalization;Deep Learning--Follow-Up Studies--Heart Failure--Humans--Myocardial Infarction--Patient Readmission--follow up--heart failure--heart infarction--hospital readmission--human;SAGE Publications Ltd;35587458;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85130300636

It is caused by the body’s immune system overreacting to an infection. Therefore, hospitalized patients can benefit from having an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based approach to alert healthcare professionals when the patient is at risk of sepsis. However, automating and diagnosing sepsis in hospitalized patients is difficult, as sepsis can present differently in each individual. However, although deep learning (DL) algorithms have demonstrated high accuracy and exemplary performance in different clinical categories, very few have been integrated into medical systems. In this paper, we introduce an interoperability platform to integrate electronic healthcare records (EHRs) and clinical modeling of mortality risk in patients with sepsis to support patient monitoring and early detection. Furthermore, we assess the training and evaluation of machine learning algorithms to classify the risk of a hospitalized patient getting sepsis using the EHRs from two hospitals released in the cardiology challenge 2019 for early sepsis prediction from clinical data. Additionally, we focus on structuring the data in units and building a clinical document architecture using the standard Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard to enable the interoperability to train and deploy the model from different hospitals. We also present a dashboard for patient monitoring and support of early detection. We evaluated GradientBoosting, and LightGradientBoostingMachine (LightGBM) classifiers on two test sets, one by each hospital EHRs, using the F1-score represents the perfect accuracy and recall of the model and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). When trained on data from hospital A, the LightGBM yields an F1-score of 0.87 and 0.26 for the two test sets. The LightGBM trained from hospital B yields an F1-score of 0.20 and 0.88 for the two test sets, while using the data training combination of two hospitals improves the prediction accuracy with an F1-score of 0.93 and 0.94 for the two test sets. The accuracy of sepsis classification in hospitalized patients relies on the diversity of the training data since we identified variations in the values of the clinical characteristics used to represent each patient’s condition. Therefore, we highlight that reliably composing a diverse and structured dataset improves the results. Also, adding a model for imputation of missing values improves the classification performance and deals with the missing data that often appear in hospitals. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;BioInformatics--Machine learning--Sepsis prediction;Bioinformatics--Classification (of information)--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Health care--Hospitals--Interoperability--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Medical informatics--Patient monitoring--Risk assessment--Electronic healthcare records--F1 scores--Health care professionals--Healthcare Interoperability--High-accuracy--Interoperability approaches--Machine-learning--Missing data imputations--Sepsis prediction--Test sets--Forecasting;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85146702336

PVC is a non-harmful common occurrence represented by extra heartbeats, whose diagnosis is not always easily identifiable, especially when done by long-term manual ECG analysis. In some cases, it may lead to disastrous consequences when associated with other pathologies. This work introduces an approach to identify PVCs using machine learning techniques without feature extraction and cross-validation techniques. In particular, a group of six classifiers has been used: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, ResNet-18, MobileNetv2, and ShuffleNet. Two types of experiments have been performed on data extracted from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database: (i) the original dataset and (ii) the balanced dataset. MobileNetv2 came in first in both experiments with high performance and promising results for PVCs' final diagnosis. The final results showed 99.90% of accuracy in the first experiment and 99.00% in the second one, despite no feature detection techniques were used. The approach we used, which was focused on classification without using feature extraction and cross-validation techniques, allowed us to provide excellent performance and obtain better results. Finally, this research defines as first step toward understanding the explanations for deep learning models' incorrect classifications.  © 2022 De Marco et al.

People affected by CVDs may go undiagnosed until the occurrence of a serious heart failure event such as stroke, heart attack, and myocardial infraction. In Qatar, there is a lack of studies focusing on CVD diagnosis based on non-invasive methods such as retinal image or dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). In this study, we aimed at diagnosing CVD using a novel approach integrating information from retinal images and DXA data. We considered an adult Qatari cohort of 500 participants from Qatar Biobank (QBB) with an equal number of participants from the CVD and the control groups. We designed a case-control study with a novel multi-modal (combining data from multiple modalities—DXA and retinal images)—to propose a deep learning (DL)-based technique to distinguish the CVD group from the control group. Uni-modal models based on retinal images and DXA data achieved 75.6% and 77.4% accuracy, respectively. The multi-modal model showed an improved accuracy of 78.3% in classifying CVD group and the control group. We used gradient class activation map (GradCAM) to highlight the areas of interest in the retinal images that influenced the decisions of the proposed DL model most. It was observed that the model focused mostly on the centre of the retinal images where signs of CVD such as hemorrhages were present. This indicates that our model can identify and make use of certain prognosis markers for hypertension and ischemic heart disease. From DXA data, we found higher values for bone mineral density, fat content, muscle mass and bone area across majority of the body parts in CVD group compared to the control group indicating better bone health in the Qatari CVD cohort. This seminal method based on DXA scans and retinal images demonstrate major potentials for the early detection of CVD in a fast and relatively non-invasive manner. © 2022 by the authors.

Inaccurate ICD coding can lower the quality of care, and delay or prevent reimbursement. However, selecting the appropriate ICD code from a patient’s clinical history is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. The rapid spread of electronic medical records (EMRs) has generated a large amount of clinical data and provides an opportunity to predict ICD codes using deep learning models. The main objective of this study was to use a deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) model to accurately predict ICD-10 codes, which could help providers to make better clinical decisions and improve their level of service. We retrospectively collected clinical notes from five outpatient departments (OPD) from one university teaching hospital between January 2016 and December 2016. We applied NLP techniques, including global vectors, word to vectors, and embedding techniques to process the data. The dataset was split into two independent training and testing datasets consisting of 90% and 10% of the entire dataset, respectively. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model was developed, and the performance was measured using the precision, recall, and F-score. A total of 21,953 medical records were collected from 5016 patients. The performance of the CNN model for the five different departments was clinically satisfactory (Precision: 0.50~0.69 and recall: 0.78~0.91). However, the CNN model achieved the best performance for the cardiology department, with a precision of 69%, a recall of 89% and an F-score of 78%. The CNN model for predicting ICD-10 codes provides an opportunity to improve the quality of care. Implementing this model in real-world clinical settings could reduce the manual coding workload, enhance the efficiency of clinical coding, and support physicians in making better clinical decisions. © 2022 by the authors.

Considering these risk factors, there is a chance that a patient can die. This is the main criterion to focus on this disease because of death rate is high. As a team, we mainly focused on four diseases that have recorded increased deaths: Heart disease, Depression, Kidney disease, and Lung Cancer. Based on this, we have surveyed the disorders to predict them at the earliest, making them easy to cure. From this survey, we learned that a high number of deaths are recorded due to heart-related issues, which 17.9 million people globally each year. It is known that diagnosis of heart disease is quite challenging, but that doesn't mean that person is on the verge of their life. There are effective ways in which a person can be gone through an automated prediction of their heart condition. Machine and deep learning algorithms are practical and efficient in producing the most accurate results. These algorithms are helpful in many ways and different fields, mainly in the medical domain, for predicting diseases based on symptoms.  © 2022 IEEE.;accuracy--death rate--Disease prediction--diseases--forecast--heart;Cardiology--Curing--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Forecasting--Heart--Learning algorithms--Accuracy--Daily lives--Death rates--Disease prediction--Forecast--Heart disease--Kidney disease--Machine learning algorithms--Prediction-based--Risk factors--Diseases;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85152034038

This paper presents an effective way of predicting heart diseases based on heart sounds produced by this e-stethoscope. Our prediction system collects heart sounds from patients using this e-stethoscope and then analyzes them to predict the disease by running various Machine-learning and Deep-learning models like KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, MLP Classifier, ANN, 1D CNN, 2D CNN, etc. We analyzed the results through the 3 datasets, Physionet, Pascal, and Our Collected Heart Dataset. MLP classifier and ANN both performed well on our dataset. A modern heart sound database platform is developed to impact the telemedicine sector worldwide.

In acute MI, accurate electrocardiography (ECG) is important for timely diagnosis and intervention in the emergency setting. Machine learning is increasingly being explored for automated computer-aided ECG diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we have developed DenseNet and CNN models for the classification of healthy subjects and patients with ten classes of MI based on the location of myocardial involvement. ECG signals from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt database were pre-processed, and the ECG beats were extracted using an R peak detection algorithm. The beats were then fed to the two models separately. While both models attained high classification accuracies (more than 95%), DenseNet is the preferred model for the classification task due to its low computational complexity and higher classification accuracy than the CNN model due to feature reusability. An enhanced class activation mapping (CAM) technique called Grad-CAM was subsequently applied to the outputs of both models to enable visualization of the specific ECG leads and portions of ECG waves that were most influential for the predictive decisions made by the models for the 11 classes. It was observed that Lead V4 was the most activated lead in both the DenseNet and CNN models. Furthermore, this study has also established the different leads and parts of the signal that get activated for each class. This is the first study to report features that influenced the classification decisions of deep models for multiclass classification of MI and healthy ECGs. Hence this study is crucial and contributes significantly to the medical field as with some level of visible explainability of the inner workings of the models, the developed DenseNet and CNN models may garner needed clinical acceptance and have the potential to be implemented for ECG triage of MI diagnosis in hospitals and remote out-of-hospital settings. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd;Deep learning--DenseNet model--Explainable artificial intelligence--Grad-CAM--Myocardial infarction;Algorithms--Deep Learning--Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted--Electrocardiography--Humans--Myocardial Infarction--Cams--Classification (of information)--Computer aided diagnosis--Computer aided instruction--Deep learning--Electrocardiography--Hospitals--Reusability--Activation mapping--Classification accuracy--CNN models--Deep learning--Densenet model--Explainable artificial intelligence--Grad-class activation mapping--Learning models--Mapping techniques--Myocardial Infarction--Article--artificial intelligence--artificial neural network--deep learning--detection algorithm--electrocardiogram--electrocardiography--grad class activation mapping--heart infarction--human--model--multiclass classification--patient triage--algorithm--computer assisted diagnosis--heart infarction--procedures--Cardiology;Elsevier Ltd;35533457;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85129766891

Nowadays, the constitution of this technology is more prevalent in clinical observation, where the wearable devices have stimulated the development of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). In the process of reducing the death rate, it is necessary to detect the disease at an earlier stage. The cardiac disease prediction is a major defect in the examination of the dataset in clinics. The research proposed aims to recognize the important cardiac complaint prediction characteristics by utilizing machine-learning methodologies. Numerous projects have been established regarding the diagnosis of cardiac complaints, which results in low accuracy rate. Thus, for improving the accuracy of prediction and for cardiac complaint investigation this article utilized a fuzzy c-means neural network (FNN) and a deep convolution neural network for feature extraction. From the clinical dataset, data were obtained for the risk prediction of cardiac complaints that includes blood pressure (BP), age, sex, chest pain, cholesterol, blood sugar, and so forth. The hearts condition is recognized by categorizing the sensor data received by FNN. The evaluation performances were carried out and the results revealed that FNN is good in predicting the cardiac complaints. In addition to this, the proposed model achieves better accuracy than the other approaches through the demonstration of simulation results. The proposed approach attains the accuracy rate of 86.4% and F1-score of 97%, precision 76.2%, and 64.6% of FPR. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.;;Blood--Blood pressure--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Extraction--Feature extraction--Forecasting--Fuzzy inference--Fuzzy neural networks--Heart--Internet of things--Accuracy rate--Cardiac disease--Clinical care--Clinical observation--Death rates--Disease diagnosis--Diverse domains--Features extraction--Fuzzy--Wearable devices--Deep neural networks;John Wiley and Sons Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85116441651

Activities within the patient’s cardiac system can be captured using an electrical conduction system and mapped on a waveform named an electrocardiogram (ECG). The abnormal heartbeats, or arrhythmias, can be seen in the ECG data. ECG signal data is vast and calls for many qualified medical professionals and resources. Machine learning has become a vast field of study to uncover the properties of ECG signals. Traditional approaches need additional efforts in feature extraction to support designing a more optimal system. Patients’ acute and chronic heart problems must be accurately diagnosed using deep machine learning. A deep learning model can be evaluated on the MIT-BIH dataset, it has available ECG data for medical research and practices. In spite of the fact that CNN accomplishes well enough to improve computer-based diagnosis. Computer automatic diagnosis in the medical field along with present-day ML techniques may be accurate and efficient in this area. An optimal deep model design & procedures for classification of electrocardiogram waveform would be helpful to bring off medical resources and brush-up research trials. In this paper, a cascade model of LSTM and RNN is proposed and compared with the existing single model on the necessary parameters to judge. Experimental evaluation is to classify irregularities in ECG signal 12 lead data collected from MIT-BIH and classified through a proposed cascading model. The proposed cascaded model archived 89.9% accuracy with 93.46% sensitivity and 84.36% specificity. The comparison results show that LSTM with RNN suits real-time generated data sequences like ECG. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Arrhythmia--Cardiac disease--CNN--Deep learning--ECG--LSTM--RNN;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Diseases--Heart--Learning systems--Long short-term memory--Arrhythmia--Arrhythmia classification--Cardiac arrhythmia--Cardiac disease--Deep learning--Electrocardiogram signal--LSTM--Machine-learning--RNN--Waveforms--Electrocardiograms;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85148688425

Kumarasamy College of Engineering, Thalavapalayam, Tamil Nadu, Karur, 639113, India--Sea Sense Softwares Pvt Ltd. Marthandam, KanyaKumari, India;Heart disease is the most life-threatening disease globally, affecting human life very critically. On-time and precise diagnosis of heart disease is vital for the prevention and treatment of heart failure. In the earlier stage, several detection techniques were developed to detect heart disease using machine learning techniques. But the heart problems have not been detected accurately with the minimum required time. This paper presented an effective heart disease prediction system that accurately diagnoses abnormality within a short duration. The feature selection process is carried with stochastic gradient boosting with a recursive feature elimination approach. For classification, the features are clustered by using the adaptive Harris hawk optimization clustering approach. Based on clustered features, the classification is processed with an enhanced deep genetic algorithm. This method improves the performance of the deep neural network by augmenting its initial weights with an enhanced genetic algorithm, which recommends better weights for the neural network. The demonstration of the proposed work is simulated in the MATLAB platform and the dataset used in UCI machine learning repository. The experimental outcome shows that the developed feature selection and classification approach attain 98.36% and 97.3% accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art techniques. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.;Clustering--Deep neural network--Feature selection--Heart disease--Optimization approach;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Clustering algorithms--Deep neural networks--Diagnosis--Diseases--Genetic algorithms--Heart--Stochastic systems--Based clustering--Classification of heart disease--Clusterings--Features selection--Heart disease--Heart failure--Human lives--Machine learning techniques--Optimisations--Optimization approach--Feature extraction;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85119701652

However, automatic pathology segmentation can be challenging due to the difficulty of effectively exploring the underlying information from the multi-sequence CMR data. This paper aims to tackle the scar and edema segmentation from multi-sequence CMR with a novel auto-weighted supervision framework, where the interactions among different supervised layers are explored under a task-specific objective using reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we design a coarse-to-fine framework to boost the small myocardial pathology region segmentation with shape prior knowledge. The coarse segmentation model identifies the left ventricle myocardial structure as a shape prior, while the fine segmentation model integrates a pixel-wise attention strategy with an auto-weighted supervision model to learn and extract salient pathological structures from the multi-sequence CMR data. Extensive experimental results on a publicly available dataset from Myocardial pathology segmentation combining multi-sequence CMR (MyoPS 2020) demonstrate our method can achieve promising performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Our method is promising in advancing the myocardial pathology assessment on multi-sequence CMR data.

We propose an phonocardiogram (PCG) classifier that combines raw spectrogram features with crafted, physician-inspired features with an end-to-end neural network architecture. Learned spectrogram features were obtained by training a convolutional neural network (CNN) directly on the raw mel-spectrogram representation of the PCG time-series. Crafted features were based on the four stages of the cardiac cycle (S1, systole, S2, and diastole). The spectrogram features have the advantage of introducing flexibility for the model to learn abstract, low-level information that captures a variety of different rhythmic abnormalities and the latter has the advantage of using segmentation to elucidate specific, high-level, human-interpretable information. Combined features are fed into a fully connected neural network which is able to learn the relationship between the two feature types. In the George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2022 test set, our team ('lubdub') received a weighted accuracy score of 0.835 with a cost of 14905 in the clinical outcome task (ranked 31/39).

Design: Prospective, longitudinal study. Participants: We analyzed imaging data from patients with intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD) (N = 316) enrolled in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) Ancillary SD-OCT with adequate SD-OCT imaging for repeated measures. Methods: Qualitative and quantitative multimodal variables from the database were derived at each yearly visit over 5 years. Based on statistical analyses developed in the field of cardiology, an algorithm was developed and used to select person-years without GA on color fundus photography or SD-OCT at baseline. The analysis used machine learning approaches to generate classification trees. Eyes were stratified as low, average, above average, and high risk in 1 or 2 years, based on OCT and demographic features by the risk of GA development or decreased VA by 5+ and 10+ letters. Main Outcome Measures: New onset of SD-OCT–determined GA and VA loss. Results: We identified multiple retinal and subretinal SD-OCT and demographic features from the baseline visit, each of which independently conveyed low to high risk of new-onset GA or VA loss on each of the follow-up visits at 1 or 2 years. Conclusions: We propose a risk-stratified classification of iAMD based on the combination of OCT-derived retinal features, age, gender, and systemic variables for progression to OCT-determined GA or VA loss. After external validation, the composite early end points may be used as exclusion or inclusion criteria for future clinical studies of iAMD focused on prevention of GA progression or VA loss. © 2022 American Academy of Ophthalmology;Classification trees--Geographic atrophy--Machine learning--Prediction--Random forest;adult--age related macular degeneration--aged--Article--cohort analysis--color fundus photography--controlled study--eye photography--follow up--geographic atrophy--human--intermediate age related macular degeneration--longitudinal study--machine learning--macular edema--major clinical study--observational study--prospective study--spectral domain optical coherence tomography--visual acuity--visual impairment;Elsevier Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85149604492

Identifying AF episodes from long-term ECG data can place a heavy burden on clinicians. Many machine-learning-based automatic AF detection methods have been proposed to solve this issue. However, these methods require numerous annotated data to train the model, and the annotation of AF in long-term ECG is extremely time-consuming. Reducing the demand for labeled data can effectively improve the clinical practicability of automatic AF detection methods. In this study, we developed a novel semi-supervised learning method that generated modified low-entropy labels of unlabeled samples for training a deep learning model to automatically detect paroxysmal AF in 24 h Holter monitoring data. Our method employed a 1D CNN-LSTM neural network with RR intervals as input and used few labeled training data with numerous unlabeled data for training the neural network. This method was evaluated using a 24 h Holter monitoring dataset collected from 1000 paroxysmal AF patients. Using labeled samples from only 10 patients for model training, our method achieved a sensitivity of 97.8%, specificity of 97.9%, and accuracy of 97.9% in five-fold cross-validation. Compared to the supervised learning method with complete labeled samples, the detection accuracy of our method was only 0.5% lower, while the workload of data annotation was significantly reduced by more than 98%. In general, this is the first study to apply semi-supervised learning techniques for automatic AF detection using ECG. Our method can effectively reduce the demand for AF data annotations and can improve the clinical practicability of automatic AF detection.  © 2013 IEEE.;Atrial fibrillation detection--deep learning--electrocardiogram--semi-supervised learning;Atrial Fibrillation--Electrocardiography--Electrocardiography, Ambulatory--Humans--Neural Networks, Computer--Supervised Machine Learning--Cardiology--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Long short-term memory--Supervised learning--Atrial fibrillation--Atrial fibrillation detection--Deep learning--Detection methods--Features extraction--Holter monitoring--Neural-networks--Paroxysmal atrial fibrillations--Recording--adult--aged--area under the curve--Article--atrial fibrillation--atrioventricular block--cross validation--data accuracy--data analysis--deep learning--diagnostic test accuracy study--electrocardiogram--entropy--female--heart atrium arrhythmia--Holter monitoring--human--image quality--learning--major clinical study--male--nerve cell network--receiver operating characteristic--sensitivity and specificity--sinus arrhythmia--sinus rhythm--training--ambulatory electrocardiography--electrocardiography--procedures--supervised machine learning--Feature extraction;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;35536820;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85132508108

Available COVID-19 diagnostic methods have been shown to have limitations. In addition to current diagnostic methods such as low-sensitivity standard RT-PCR tests and expensive medical imaging devices, the development of alternative methods for the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease would be beneficial for control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, it is important to quickly and accurately detect abnormalities caused by COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system via ECG. In this study, the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease is proposed using a novel deep Convolutional Neural Network model by using only ECG trace images created from ECG signals of COVID-19 infected patients based on the abnormalities caused by the COVID-19 virus on the cardiovascular system. An overall classification accuracy of 98.57%, 93.20%, 96.74% and AUC value of 0.9966, 0.9771, 0.9905 is achieved for COVID-19 vs. Normal, COVID-19 vs. Abnormal Heartbeats, COVID-19 vs. Myocardial Infarction binary classification tasks, respectively. In addition, an overall classification accuracy of 86.55% and 83.05% is achieved for COVID-19 vs. Abnormal Heartbeats vs. Myocardial Infarction and Normal vs. COVID-19 vs. Abnormal Heartbeats vs. Myocardial Infarction multi-classification tasks.

These datasets are commonly extracted at scale from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Typically, a single physician over-reads the machine generated interpretation as part of standard care. Incorrect interpretation of the ECG occurs frequently, reducing the quality of the labels. Method: We trained a DNN to identify seven ECG rhythms based on morphology--Sinus Rhythm, Junctional Rhythm, Ectopic Atrial Rhythm, Atrial Flutter, Atrial Fibrillation, Ventricular Rhythm and Pacemaker. The DNN was trained on a dataset of 368,202 ECGs taken from a proprietary database. We then applied confident learning techniques using the DNN to identify label errors in the Physionet PTB-XL database, which is publicly available. Results: The confident learning algorithm identified 515 potential rhythm label errors in the 21,837 ECGs in PTB-XL database (2.36%). The labels were sorted by the likelihood of label error based on the self-confidence score, and the top 200 ECGs were manually reviewed. Of these 200 ECGs, 158 were found to be incorrectly labelled (79%). Confident learning successfully corrected the label in 156 cases (78%). The estimated labelling error rate for ECG rhythm in the PTB-XL database is 1.86%. © 2022 Creative Commons.;;Cardiology--Database systems--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Errors--Large dataset--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Atrial fibrillation--Atrial flutter--Automated identification--Electronic health--Health records--Large datasets--Learning techniques--PhysioNet--Sinus rhythm--Training and testing--Electrocardiograms;IEEE Computer Society;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85152886322

Thus, initial screening of the chest is much needed to avoid the diseases like Covid-19, lung cancer, heart disease, and many other conditions before these are caused to severe. However, the biggest advancement of the X-ray machine is that it uses a very modest dosage of ionizing radiation to obtain images of the inside of the chest. In the meantime, Deep learning (DL) in healthcare provides a prominent solution to identify the disease from the huge amount of medical images. The DL-based Transfer Learning (TL) model acts as a powerful technique for extracting feature when there have been less amount of data, and also has the potential to provide a promising solution. Thus, a TL model called ResNet50V2 has been proposed for detecting pneumonia from 5216 sample images. This model has been evaluated successfully with 10 epochs and predicts pneumonia with an accuracy of 99.69%. This might also help the doctors to predict other diseases like lung cancer, Covid-19, and Heart failure before these become to death. © 2022 IEEE.;chest X-ray--CNN--DL--ResNet50V2--Transfer learning;Biological organs--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Ionizing radiation--Learning systems--Medical imaging--Chest X-ray--Chest X-ray image--Condition--Deep learning--Heart disease--Learning models--Lung Cancer--Resnet50v2--Transfer learning--X ray machine--Diseases;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85152456167

Detecting arousals is a time-consuming process manually per-formed by a trained expert. The required measurement is performed on an inpatient basis and is uncomfortable for the patient. As arousals relate to the autonomic nervous system, they also reflect in the electrocardiogram, which is therefore a promising alternative biosignal. In this study, we developed a deep learning model for automatic detection of sleep arousals from heart rate. We developed our algorithm using 5323 recordings from the Sleep Heart Health Study. 1003 of them were held-out as test data. We derived RR intervals from the ECG and interpolated them into a 4 Hz signal. Next, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) for end-to-end event detection. Model output is a continuous arousal probabil-ity with a frequency of 1 Hz. The optimization resulted in a twelve-layer CNN that achieved a Cohens kappa of 0.47, an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.54 on hold-out test data. This study demonstrates the ability of machine learning to detect arousals during sleep from heart rate. As our approach uses only the heart rate, it is potentially trans-ferable to other signals, e.g. the photoplethysmogram. © 2022 Creative Commons.;;Cardiology--Chemical detection--Curve fitting--Deep learning--Heart--Sleep research--Automatic Detection--Autonomic nervous--Biosignals--Convolutional neural network--Heart-rate--Learning models--Pathophysiology--Sleep disorders--Sleep quality--Test data--Electrocardiograms;IEEE Computer Society;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85152924307

High speed, drink-driving, distracting thoughts, overstress, and malfunctioning electronic gadgets, over the temperature in charging are the leading causes of accidents & fire. Also, in electric battery-operated cars, if the battery charging mechanism is not properly thermally stabilized, the battery may catch fire. As a result, the proposed system deals with accident detection systems that occur as a result of a driver's carelessness or system failure while operating an electric vehicle. Proposed Device created with a cardiac sensor in the seat belt and vehicle along with battery temperature, vibration & accelerometer sensors which can help to analyze the vehicle's yaw, roll, pitch, and slip motions. All of the data collected is a synced to ESP-32 controller through IoT-based cloud storage analysis to notify a neighboring helpline center about the accident. This data is also utilized in an AI-based model to detect one of the sovereign sources of death in growing countries i.e., cardiovascular disease, and it's cited by several throughout the globe. Cardiovascular disease, on the opposite hand, is called heart disease. This consolidates some dangerous factors of heart disease and the desire of the era of promoting correct, reliable and smart approaches that enable early identification to achieve quick treatment for the disease. This analysis paper also presents numerous attributes associated with a heart condition, and also the model is based on supervised algorithms of machine learning such as Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Decision tree, and random forest and algorithms of deep learning such as Artificial Neural Network, TabNet etc. It uses the prevailing dataset from V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach, and Cleveland Clinic Foundation: Robert Detrano, M.D., Ph.D. It includes 303 occurrences and 76 attributes. Only 13 attributes are considered for testing out of 76 attributes. This is important to prove the performance of various algorithms.

Upward trends in publications may indicate increasing interest in the use of artificial intelligence in these crucial fields. Design/setting: To evaluate evidence of increasing publications on the use of artificial intelligence in cardiology and oncology, historical trends in related publications on PubMed (the biomedical repository most frequently used by clinicians and scientists in these fields) were reviewed. Results: Findings indicated that research output related to artificial intelligence (and its subcategories) generally increased over time, particularly in the last five years. With some initial degree of vacillation in publication trends, a slight qualitative inflection was noted in approximately 2015, in general publications and especially for oncology and cardiology, with subsequent consistent exponential growth. Publications predominantly focused on “machine learning” (n = 20,301), which contributed to the majority of the accelerated growth in the field, compared to “artificial intelligence” (n = 4535), “natural language processing” (n = 2608), and “deep learning” (n = 4459). Conclusion: Trends in the general biomedical literature and particularly in cardiology and oncology indicated exponential growth over time. Further exponential growth is expected in future years, as awareness and cross-disciplinary collaboration and education increase. Publications specifically on machine learning will likely continue to lead the way. © 2022 The Authors;Artificial intelligence--Bibliometric analysis--Deep learning--Machine learning--Natural language processing;;Elsevier Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85153892389

Feature extraction algorithms play a vital role in biomedical signal processing (BSP). For that purpose, the chaos analysis theory is used as a feature extraction tool on different pathological datasets obtained from different cardiology labs to classify different arrhythmia types. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is evaluated on different performance evaluating parameters, viz., sensitivity (Se), accuracy (Acc), and duplicity (D).

As such effective diagnosis from heart and lung sounds is often subject to clinician's experience and his/her hearing capability. Hence adaptive noise cancellation and separation of heart and lung sounds is an area of intensive research. Conventionally doctors detect respiratory diseases through auscultation, by advising the patients to take deep breaths of their own for the distinct hearing of the chest sounds and for masking any other noise. But it is unfeasible for patients who are in a coma and for infants. In the case of doctors with less experience, it is a common practice to send the patients for different pulmonary function tests to ensure the disease. But it might take a day or more to get the results and may charge an additional expense to the patients. The paper discusses the development of a 3-D printed electronic stethoscope that can separate heart and lung sounds and support in diagnosing lung diseases in a glimpse of time. The separation of the acquired lung sounds from the stethoscope model is done using frequency-based filtering and Adaptive Line Enhancer (ALE) algorithms implemented in a Teensy 4.0 supported with an audio sheild. The obtained lung sounds are later transferred to the computer where the signals are displayed and Machine learning algorithms are employed to detect abnormal lung sounds that are indicative of different lung disorders. The conditions investigated are Wheezes, Crackle, Both, Without, Normal. The features extraction techniques which used are FFT, MFCC and Spectral imaging. The signal processing is done using Python, on the Google Colab platform. A comparative analysis of accuracy of different machine learning algorithms are carried out, namely, SVM (Support Vector Machine), KNN (K Nearest neighbor), Naive Bayes and CNN. The best model obtained was CNN with MFCC features, resulting in an overall accuracy of 70% for ICBH Database and 61.5% for hospital data samples. Since lung disorders are becoming one of the biggest killers in the world, this stethoscope will be unquestionably a handy and intelligent tool for pulmonologists.  © 2022 IEEE.;companion--feedback system--Rehabilitation--sedentary;Audition--Biological organs--Cardiology--Learning algorithms--Nearest neighbor search--Support vector machines--Adaptive noise cancellations--Automated detection and classification--Clinical settings--Companion--Feedback systems--Heart sounds--Lung sounds--Machine learning algorithms--Noise separation--Sedentary--Diagnosis;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85146661141

To save lives from the HD, early and robust detection method is essential. The HD of a subject can be diagnosed by clinical test attributes, the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, heart sound signal, impedance cardiography (ICG), magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography (CT). In this paper, the problem of detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) using ECG signal as the prime source has been undertaken by developing four different deep learning (DL) models such as autoencoder (AE), radial basis function network (RBFN), self-organizing map (SOM) and restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Two public arrhythmia datasets: PTB-ECG and MIT-BIH have been used for training and validation of the proposed models. Further, an ensemble classification model has been developed by combining two best performing AE and SOM models using the principle of majority voting. Simulation based experiments using two standard datasets demonstrate that the AE model providing accuracy, F1-score and area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.974, 0.932 and 0.922 for MIT-BIH dataset and 0.984, 0.967 and 0.932 for PTB-ECG datasets respectively outperforms the other three models. It is further observed that the proposed SOM - AE ensemble model exhibits the best performance compared to the AE model with accuracy, F1-score and AUC values of 0.984, 0.971, 0.997 for MIT-BIH as well as 0.992, 0.986 and 0.995 for PTB-ECG datasets respectively. The detection models presented in this work can further be employed for other different diseases. The robustness and other performance measures can be obtained by applying larger and more imbalanced datasets to the DL models. In addition, internet of things (IoT) based diagnosis platform can be developed using proposed approach for online detection of CAD which would be beneficial for detecting remote CAD patients. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.;CAD--DL based CAD classification--Early detection--Ensemble CAD detection--Imbalanced data;Cardiology--Computer aided diagnosis--Computerized tomography--Conformal mapping--Deep learning--Electrocardiography--Heart--Internet of things--Magnetic resonance imaging--Radial basis function networks--Self organizing maps--Auto encoders--Coronary artery disease--Deep learning based coronary artery disease classification--Disease classification--Disease detection--Early detection--Ensemble coronary artery disease detection--Imbalanced data--Diseases;Elsevier Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85127116419

The purpose of this systematic review is to provide an understanding of NLP, review how it has been used to date within cardiology and illustrate the opportunities that this approach provides for both research and clinical care. We systematically searched six scholarly databases (ACM Digital Library, Arxiv, Embase, IEEE Explore, PubMed and Scopus) for studies published in 2015–2020 describing the development or application of NLP methods for clinical text focused on cardiac disease. Studies not published in English, lacking a description of NLP methods, non-cardiac focused and duplicates were excluded. Two independent reviewers extracted general study information, clinical details and NLP details and appraised quality using a checklist of quality indicators for NLP studies. We identified 37 studies developing and applying NLP in heart failure, imaging, coronary artery disease, electrophysiology, general cardiology and valvular heart disease. Most studies used NLP to identify patients with a specific diagnosis and extract disease severity using rule-based NLP methods. Some used NLP algorithms to predict clinical outcomes. A major limitation is the inability to aggregate findings across studies due to vastly different NLP methods, evaluation and reporting. This review reveals numerous opportunities for future NLP work in cardiology with more diverse patient samples, cardiac diseases, datasets, methods and applications. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.;;Algorithms--Cardiology--Electronic Health Records--Humans--Natural Language Processing--anticoagulant agent--anticoagulant therapy--Article--cardiac resynchronization therapy--cardiology--clinical outcome--conditional random field--convolutional neural network--coronary artery disease--data extraction--decision tree--deep learning--disease classification--disease severity--echocardiography--entity recognition--exercise test--health care quality--heart disease--heart electrophysiology--heart failure--human--logistic regression analysis--machine learning--measurement accuracy--medication compliance--natural language processing--nuclear magnetic resonance imaging--predictive value--random forest--receiver operating characteristic--recurrent neural network--sensitivity and specificity--systematic review--transcatheter aortic valve implantation--valvular heart disease--algorithm--electronic health record;BMJ Publishing Group;34711662;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85130919343

The International Classification of Disease (ICD) is a standardized and widely used method, but the manual classification is an enormously time-consuming endeavor. Natural language processing together with machine learning allows automated structuring of diagnoses using ICD-10 codes, but the limited performance of machine learning models, the necessity of gigantic datasets, and poor reliability of terminal parts of these codes restricted clinical usability. We aimed to create a high performing pipeline for automated classification of reliable ICD-10 codes in the free medical text in cardiology. We focussed on frequently used and well-defined three- and four-digit ICD-10 codes that still have enough granularity to be clinically relevant such as atrial fibrillation (I48), acute myocardial infarction (I21), or dilated cardiomyopathy (I42.0). Our pipeline uses a deep neural network known as a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit Neural Network and was trained and tested with 5548 discharge letters and validated in 5089 discharge and procedural letters. As in clinical practice discharge letters may be labeled with more than one code, we assessed the single- and multilabel performance of main diagnoses and cardiovascular risk factors. We investigated using both the entire body of text and only the summary paragraph, supplemented by age and sex. Given the privacy-sensitive information included in discharge letters, we added a de-identification step. The performance was high, with F1 scores of 0.76–0.99 for three-character and 0.87–0.98 for four-character ICD-10 codes, and was best when using complete discharge letters. Adding variables age/sex did not affect results. For model interpretability, word coefficients were provided and qualitative assessment of classification was manually performed. Because of its high performance, this pipeline can be useful to decrease the administrative burden of classifying discharge diagnoses and may serve as a scaffold for reimbursement and research applications. © 2021, The Author(s).;;Cardiology--Codes (symbols)--Deep neural networks--Diagnosis--Diseases--Learning algorithms--Natural language processing systems--Network coding--Recurrent neural networks--Risk assessment--Scaffolds--Text processing--amlodipine--gliclazide--insulin--metformin--perindopril--prescription drug--rosuvastatin--valsartan--Discharge letters--Epidemiological studies--International classification of disease--Manual classification--Multi-labels--Multilabel--Natural languages--Neural-networks--Performance--Risk factors--acute heart infarction--adult--age--aged--Article--atrial fibrillation--bidirectional gated recurrent unit neural network--cardiology--cardiovascular risk--clinical practice--congestive cardiomyopathy--deep neural network--diabetes mellitus--diagnosis--electronic health record--female--gated recurrent unit network--heart failure--human--hypertension--ICD-10--information retrieval--instrument validation--intermethod comparison--ischemic heart disease--lingua franca--male--medical information--medical terminology--natural language processing--Netherlands--prescription--priority journal--qualitative analysis--sex--word processing--Pipelines;Nature Research;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85101734466

However, in existing detection algorithms for paroxysmal AF (AFp), the location of AF starting and ending points in AFp is not concerned. To achieve an accurate identification of AFp events in the long-term dynamic electrocardiograms (ECGs), this paper proposes a two-step method based on machine learning. In the first step, based on features extracted from the calculated R-to-R intervals (RR intervals, the cycle of heart beat), the rhythm type of the ECG signal is first classified into three classes (AFp rhythm, persistent AF (AFf) rhythm, and nonatrial fibrillation (non-AF, N) rhythm) using support vector machine (SVM). In the second step, the starting and ending points for AF episodes of AFp rhythms predicted in the first step are further located based on heartbeat classification. By training a deep convolutional neural network with phased training, the segmented beats of AFp rhythms are divided into AF beats and non-AF beats to determine the beginning and end of any AF episode. The proposed two-step method is trained and tested on the 4th China Physiological Signal Challenge 2021 databases. A final score U of 1.9310 is obtained on the unpublished test set maintained by the challenge organizers, which demonstrates the advantage of the two-step method in AFp event detection. The work is useful for assessing AF burden index for AFp patients. © 2022 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

Detection of MI and information regarding its occurrence-time in particular, would enable timely interventions that may improve patient outcomes, thereby reducing the global rise in CVD deaths. Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings are currently used to screen MI patients. However, manual inspection of ECGs is time-consuming and prone to subjective bias. Machine learning methods have been adopted for automated ECG diagnosis, but most approaches require extraction of ECG beats or consider leads independently of one another. We propose an end-to-end deep learning approach, DeepMI, to classify MI from Normal cases as well as identifying the time-occurrence of MI (defined as Acute, Recent and Old), using a collection of fusion strategies on 12 ECG leads at data-, feature-, and decision-level. In order to minimise computational overhead, we employ transfer learning using existing computer vision networks. Moreover, we use recurrent neural networks to encode the longitudinal information inherent in ECGs. We validated DeepMI on a dataset collected from 17,381 patients, in which over 323,000 samples were extracted per ECG lead. We were able to classify Normal cases as well as Acute, Recent and Old onset cases of MI, with AUROCs of 96.7%, 82.9%, 68.6% and 73.8%, respectively. We have demonstrated a multi-lead fusion approach to detect the presence and occurrence-time of MI. Our end-to-end framework provides flexibility for different levels of multi-lead ECG fusion and performs feature extraction via transfer learning. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.;Deep learning--Heart disease--Myocardial infarction--Onset time detection--Transfer learning;Electrocardiography--Humans--Machine Learning--Myocardial Infarction--Neural Networks, Computer--Chemical detection--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Extraction--Patient treatment--Recurrent neural networks--Cardiovascular disease--Deep learning--Electrocardiogram recordings--End to end--Heart disease--Myocardial Infarction--Onset time detection--Onset-time--Time detection--Transfer learning--Article--computer vision--deep learning--electrocardiogram--heart infarction--human--machine learning--major clinical study--mortality--recurrent neural network--sensitivity and specificity--transfer of learning--treatment outcome--electrocardiography--Cardiology;Elsevier B.V.;34763807;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85118505491

In the medical system, auscultation of the heart is still an essential process, because it is very easy and inexpensive. An automated system will allow this would be extremely satisfying, and affordable heart medical monitoring for the overall population is useful for identifying potential heart abnormalities at an early stage. Through examining the signals from the phonocardiogram, cardiac diagnosis can be done, and the possibility of irregularities can be identified at an early stage. Hence, the design of the phonocardiogram’s smart and automatic analysis tools is very relevant. The PCG signals are obtained as per the primary collection of the Physionet challenge. This goal to evaluate the PCG signal is clinically “healthy” or “unhealthy” in condition. The key improvement in collaborating methods of time feature and frequency feature extracting from PCG enhances accurate identification of cardiovascular disease. The IoT-based ensemble method has been proposed with time, frequency features, and mfcc features. The classifier algorithms used in this work are K nearest neighbor, SVM, and Ensemble. The Ensemble methods obtained better accuracy and sensitivity. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Boosting--Bootstrap aggregate--Classification--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Denoising--Ensemble methods--Envelope analysis--Feature extraction--Heart diseases--IoT--K nearest neighbor--Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients--Pcc signal--Peak identification--Support vector machine;Automation--Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Diseases--Feature extraction--Heart--Motion compensation--Nearest neighbor search--Phonocardiography--Support vector machines--Boosting--Bootstrap aggregate--Convolutional neural network--De-noising--Deep learning--Ensemble methods--Envelope analysis--Features extraction--Heart disease--K near neighbor--Mel frequency cepstral co-efficient--Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients--Nearest-neighbour--Pcc signal--Peak identification--Support vectors machine--Internet of things;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Book chapter;Scopus;2-s2.0-85118667220

The comparison is performed by using time series of the heart sound signal, so-called Phonocardiography (PCG). The classification objective is to discriminate between healthy and patients with cardiac diseases by applying a deep machine learning method to PCGs. This approach which is called intelligent phonocardiography has received interest from the researchers toward the development of a smart stethoscope for decentralized diagnosis of heart disease. It is found that DTGNN associates further flexibility to the approach which enables the classifier to learn subtle contents of PCG, and meanwhile better copes with the complexities intrinsically that exist in the medical applications such as the imbalance training. The structural risk of the two methods is compared using the A-Test method. © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.;A-Test method--deep learning--Deep time growing neural network--heart sounds--intelligent phonocardiography;Heart Diseases--Heart Sounds--Humans--Machine Learning--Neural Networks, Computer--Phonocardiography--Cardiology--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep neural networks--Heart--Learning systems--Medical informatics--Phonocardiography--Testing--A-test method--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Deep time growing neural network--Heart sounds--Intelligent phonocardiography--Learning methods--Neural-networks--Test method--Times series--diagnostic imaging--heart disease--heart sound--human--machine learning--phonocardiography--Medical applications;IOS Press BV;35773918;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85133237966

Because of lifestyle and patrimonial, different kinds of disease are increasing day by day. Among all those diseases, heart disease turns out to be the most common disease and the impact of this ailment is dangerous than all other diseases. In this paper, we compared a number of computational intelligence techniques for the prediction of coronary artery heart disease. Seven computational intelligence techniques named as Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Decision Tree (DT), Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) were applied and a comparative study was drawn. The performance of each technique was evaluated using Statlog and Cleveland heart disease dataset which are retrieved from the UCI machine learning repository database with several evaluation techniques. From the study, it can be carried out that the highest accuracy of 98.15% obtained by deep neural network with sensitivity and precision 98.67% and 98.01% respectively.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving transdisciplinary field employing machine learning (ML) techniques, which aim to simulate human intuition to offer cost-effective and scalable solutions to better manage CVD. ML algorithms are increasingly being developed and applied in various facets of cardiovascular medicine, including and not limited to heart failure, electrophysiology, valvular heart disease and coronary artery disease. Within heart failure, AI algorithms can augment diagnostic capabilities and clinical decision-making through automated cardiac measurements. Occult cardiac disease is increasingly being identified using ML from diagnostic data. Improved diagnostic and prognostic capabilities using ML algorithms are enhancing clinical care of patients with valvular heart disease and coronary artery disease.

ECG data acquired from the real-time or clinical databases contains exceptional values or extreme values called outliers. The separation and removal of outliers is very much useful for improving the data quality. The presence of outliers will influence the results of machine learning (ML) methods such as classification and regression. Outlier identification and removal plays a significant role in this area of research and is a part of signal denoising. Also, most of the traditional ECG-signal processing methods are facing the difficulty in finding the essential key features of recorded signal. In this work, an extreme outlier detection technique known as improved inter quartile range (IIQR) filtering method is used to find the outliers of the signal for the feature ranking process. In addition, an optimized random forest (ORF) based heterogenous ensemble classification model is proposed to improve the true positive and runtime on the ECG data. The classification of each heartbeat type is classified with majority voting technique. Ensemble learning and majority voting rule is used to enhance the accuracy of heart disease prediction. The proposed feature ranking based ORF ensemble classification model (LR + SVM + ORF + XGBoost + KNN) is evaluated on the MITBIH arrhythmia database and produces an overall accuracy of 99.45% which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods such as, (LR + SVM + RF + XGBoost + KNN) with 96.17% accuracy, ensemble deep learning accuracy of 95.81% and ensemble SVM accuracy of 94.47%. © 2022.

Hence, we propose a novel deep neural network (DNN)-based prediction model for the major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) occurrences in patients with non-ST-Elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) to improve the prediction accuracy of CVD. The research contents are described as follows. First, for the experiment, we use the Korean Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry (KAMIR-NIH) dataset with 2 years follow-ups and then preprocess the extracted data, such as processing the missing values, solving the imbalance problem, and applying the normalization meth to scale all the datasets in the same range for the experiment. Then we design a DNN-based prognosis model for the occurrences of MACE in NSTEMI patients. Finally, we evaluate the proposed model's performance and compare it with several applied machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, decision tree, and support vector machine. The result shows that the performance of our proposed method outperformed other machine learning-based prediction models. © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.;Cardiovascular disease--Deep learning--Imbalanced data--Major adverse cardiovascular event--NSTEMI;Cardiology--Data handling--Decision trees--Diagnosis--Diseases--Forecasting--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Nearest neighbor search--Neural network models--Support vector machines--Cardiovascular disease--Cardiovascular event--Deep learning--Imbalanced data--Major adverse cardiovascular event--Myocardial Infarction--Network-based--Neural network model--Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction--Prediction modelling--Deep neural networks;IOS Press BV;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85119211728

It creates immediate heart arrest or a blockage and leads to death. Nearly 70% of people are suffering from these diseases. One of the major diseases that affect the heart is myocardial infarction (MI). MI occurs when there is some damage to the heart muscle. There are various test measures for diagnosing myocardial infarction. A common way to diagnose heart diseases in the medical field is electrocardiogram (ECG). In diagnosing MI through ECG, the changes that occur in the ECG wave are ST-Elevation MI (STEMI), non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI), and left bundle branch block (LBBB). In this study, we discuss different classification methods for the diagnosis of MI. Before the classification of the diseases, preprocessing is a preliminary task to achieve accurate information. In comparison with KNN, SVM, and YOLOv3 algorithm, LSTM could give better classification results for the diagnosis of MI.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Heart failure (HF) is a main cause of death that must be successfully predicted (HF). Angiography, the gold standard for clinical diagnosis of HF, is expensive and can have catastrophic repercussions, according to research. In this scenario, machine learning and deep learning are applied. Machine learning and deep learning techniques can be used to forecast the whole range of hazards associated with this project. This dataset is created by combining previously available datasets. For your convenience, they are sorted into eleven distinct categories. This investigation would not be possible without this information. According to the findings, machine learning approaches exceeded deep learning in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. PCA approach has been utilized to estimate the relative relevance of each of the dataset's 11 fields. When sample approaches are applied, accuracy and recall rates increased. According to the data, Random Forest Classifiers, Decision Tree Classifiers, and Naive Bayes algorithms surpass other MI algorithms. © 2022 IEEE.;Deep Learning--Feature selection--PCA--supervised learning;Clinical research--Decision trees--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Heart--Learning algorithms--Causes of death--Clinical diagnosis--Deep learning--Features selection--Gold standards--Heart disease--Heart failure--Learning techniques--Machine-learning--PCA--Cardiology;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85131924329

It has remained one of the most challenging diagnoses in cardiology. Myocardial is the prime cause of unexpected death in approximately 20% of adults less than 40 years of age. Cardiac MRI (CMR) has been considered a noninvasive and golden standard diagnostic tool for suspected myocarditis and plays an indispensable role in diagnosing various cardiac diseases. However, the performance of CMR depends heavily on the clinical presentation and features such as chest pain, arrhythmia, and heart failure. Besides, other imaging factors like artifacts, technical errors, pulse sequence, acquisition parameters, contrast agent dose, and more importantly qualitatively visual interpretation can affect the result of the diagnosis. This paper introduces a new deep learning-based model called Convolutional Neural Network-Clustering (CNN-KCL) to diagnose Myocarditis. In this study, we used 47 subjects with a total number of 98,898 images to diagnose myocarditis disease. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 97.41% based on 10 fold-cross validation technique with 4 clusters for diagnosis of Myocarditis. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first to use deep learning algorithms for the diagnosis of myocarditis. © 2022 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.;Biomedical machine learning--Cardiac MRI--Convolutional neural network--Diagnosis--Myocarditis--Prediction;Adult--Algorithms--Cluster Analysis--Humans--Magnetic Resonance Imaging--Myocarditis--Neural Networks, Computer--Cardiology--Convolution--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Heart--K-means clustering--Learning algorithms--Biomedical machine learning--Cardiac MRI--Convolutional neural network--Heart muscles--Heart wall--K-means++ clustering--Middle layer--Myocarditi--Neural network clustering--Viral infections--adult--algorithm--cluster analysis--diagnostic imaging--human--myocarditis--nuclear magnetic resonance imaging--Convolutional neural networks;American Institute of Mathematical Sciences;35240789;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85123456949

Due to the lack of a healthy lifestyle, HD would cause frequent mortality worldwide. If the heart attack occurs without any symptoms, it cannot be cured by an intelligent detection system. An effective diagnosis and detection of CHD should prevent human casualties. Moreover, intelligent systems employ clinical-based decision support approaches to assist physicians in providing another option for diagnosing and detecting HD. This paper aims to introduce a heart disease prediction model including phases like (i) Feature extraction, (ii) Feature selection, and (iii) Classification. At first, the feature extraction process is carried out, where the features like a time-domain index, frequency-domain index, geometrical domain features, nonlinear features, WT features, signal energy, skewness, entropy, kurtosis features are extracted from the input ECG signal. The curse of dimensionality becomes a severe issue. This paper provides the solution for this issue by introducing a new Modified Principal Component Analysis known as Multiple Kernel-based PCA for dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, the dimensionally reduced feature set is then subjected to a classification process, where the hybrid classifier combining both Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is used. At last, the performance analysis of the adopted scheme is compared over other existing schemes in terms of specific measures. © 2022 CRL Publishing.

Diabetes is becoming a significant concern, and Diabetes patients have a substantially higher risk of heart disease morbidity and mortality than people without diabetes. These conditions are associated with hospitalizations and emergency room visits, which raises healthcare expenses. An important strategy to improve health care outcomes and reduce unnecessary costs is to identify and anticipate them in patients. Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) assess patient data from clinical datasets to help disease prediction and enhance treatment options for heart disease and diabetes, and other disorders. According to the literature, most CDSS have used machine learning algorithms for predicting heart disease and diabetes. These algorithms performed worthily, but the accuracy of these machine learning (ML) algorithms is lacking, especially in medical data, which contains numerous complex attributes such as resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, and thalassemia value. This proposed work developed a majority voting ensembled feature selection (MVEFS) technique and customized deep neural network (CDNN) to develop a CDSS for heart disease and diabetes prediction. This deep neural network-based CDSS best performing than ML-based CDSS. There are several input attributes in the clinical dataset. Some attributes are not associated with disease and have negative consequences when used in clinical data analysis for disease prediction. As a result, feature selection is essential for removing unimportant features. The feature selection significantly minimizes system learning time, which improves CDSS performance efficacy. The MVEFS selects the associated heart disease and diabetes-related features from the clinical dataset. The classifier execution time, accuracy, sensitivity, precision, specificity, and F1-score are the performance metrics used to evaluate the proposed CDSS. According to our experimental study, the MVEFS with a customized deep neural network is more appropriate for predicting heart and diabetes than machine learning algorithms. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;Customized deep neural network--diabetes prediction--heart disease prediction--majority voting ensembled feature selection;Blood--Blood pressure--Cardiology--Decision support systems--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Feature Selection--Hospital data processing--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Patient treatment--Clinical decision support systems--Customized deep neural network--Diabetes prediction--Features selection--Global health--Health issues--Heart disease--Heart disease prediction--Machine learning algorithms--Majority voting ensembled feature selection--Forecasting;Taylor and Francis Ltd.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85130242379

Heart disease is emerging as the single most critical cause of death worldwide and is one of the costliest chronic conditions. Purpose. Stimulated by the increasing heart disease mortality rate incidents, an effective, low-cost, and reliable heart disease risk evaluation model is developed using significant non-invasive risk attributes. The significant non-invasive risk attributes like (age, systolic BP, diastolic BP, BMI, hereditary factor, smoking, alcohol, and physical inactivity) are identified by the help of medical domain experts, and their reliability in heart disease prediction is investigated through different feature selection techniques. Methodology. The enhancements of applying specific investigated techniques like random forest, Naïve Bayes, decision tree, support vector machine, and K nearest neighbor to the risk factors are tested. The heart disease risk assessment model is developed using the Jupyter Notebook web application, and its performance is tested not only through medical domain measures but also through the model performance measures. Findings. To evaluate heart disease risk evaluation model, we calculated measures of discrimination like error rate, AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, and so on. Experimental results show that the random forest heart disease risk evaluation model outperforms other existing risk models with admirable predictive accuracy and minimum misclassification rate. Originality. The heart disease risk evaluation model is developed based on novel non-invasive heart disease dataset, which consists of 5776 records. This dataset is collected from different heterogeneous data sources of Kashmir (India) through quantitative data collection methods. Research Implications. The risk model is applicable where people lack the facilities of integrated primary medical care technologies for untimely heart disease risk prediction. Future Work. To investigate deep learning and study the significance of other controlled attributes on different age and sex groups in the risk estimation of heart disease. © 2022 Syed Immamul Ansarullah et al.;;Bayes Theorem--Heart Diseases--Humans--Machine Learning--Reproducibility of Results--Support Vector Machine--Cardiology--Decision trees--Deep learning--Diseases--Forecasting--Heart--Nearest neighbor search--Risk perception--Support vector machines--Causes of death--Disease risks--Evaluation models--Heart disease--Machine learning techniques--Medical domains--Prediction of heart disease--Random forests--Risk evaluation--Risk modeling--Bayes theorem--heart disease--human--machine learning--reproducibility--support vector machine--Risk assessment;Hindawi Limited;35237314;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85125612123

It is at the focal point of the circulatory framework. Heart disease is a potentially fatal condition that can result in death or severe long-term impairment. Therefore, efficient techniques for uncovering hidden linkages and there are no clear patterns in e-health data. Medical diagnosis is a difficult task that is crucial to preserving lives, so it must be done correctly and quickly. To lower the cost of performing clinical tests, a suitable and precise computer-based automated decision support system is necessary. The use of machine learning in health analytics has been presented as a way to anticipate reliable patient data analysis. The information generated by the healthcare industry is not mined. In the medical industry, data mining techniques can be utilized to create an intelligent model employing data sets that include patient risk factors. The emergence of ideas and techniques for making use of data has surprised knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). This study delves into the usage of deep learning and machine learning approaches in disease diagnosis. In recent years, many data mining classifiers have been created to aid in the accurate and timely identification of illnesses. This study offers a heart attack forecasting model based on deep learning methodologies, notably Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), to anticipate a patient's likelihood of acquiring heart disease. MLP is an advanced type approach that employs the Artificial Neural Network's Deep Learning approach. Deep learning and data mining are used in the suggested approach to get reliable and error-free outcomes. © 2022 IEEE.;Artificial intelligence--Data Science and Engineering--Deep learning--Heart disease--Multi-layer perceptron;Artificial heart--Cardiology--Decision support systems--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Heart--Medical computing--Multilayer neural networks--Cardiovascular disease--Condition--Data science and engineering--Deep learning--Focal points--Heart disease--Human bodies--Multilayers perceptrons--Potentially fatal--Science and engineering--Data mining;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85131960630

Various factors like Age, Blood Pressure, Stressful life, and work culture have shown the impact on increasing the cases of CVD causing many deaths, and hence its early detection is of paramount importance. Smart healthcare for preventive measures is becoming a popular trend due to technological advancements and the use of artificial intelligence via machine learning and deep learning methodologies. In this study, we had applied various supervised machine learning algorithms on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset of ECG signals and performed a comparative analysis of different classification methods. Decision Tree Classification (DTC) with Gini and entropy criteria, support vector classification (SVC) with all proper hyperparameter tunning is applied on a dataset obtained from the PhysioNet. From the results obtained, we had analyzed that the Decision Tree approach on a given dataset gave a maximum accuracy of 95.45%. So by using this Decision Tree algorithm, CVD detection will be helpful in the medical field. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;Cardiovascular disease (CVD)--Dataset and Machine Learning (ML)--Decision Tree (DT)--Detection approaches;Blood pressure--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Decision trees--Deep learning--Learning algorithms--Supervised learning--Cardiovascular disease--Causes of death--Coronary heart disease--Dataset and machine learning--Decision tree--Detection approach--Machine-learning--Performances analysis--Preventive measures--Diseases;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85130911324

The early diagnosis can significantly reduce the risk of death and can be useful to drive successful treatment. However, the early diagnosis requires continuous monitoring of a large set of clinical and lifestyle indicators.This is the reason why there is an increasing number of studies aimed to adopt machine learning to predict heart disease starting from the analysis of the vast range of clinical data that we can collect today thanks to the advent of patients' digital folders. This work investigates the adoption of a large set of machine learning and deep learning classifiers to predict heart disease from the data gathered by a proposed feature model. The study also proposes hyperparameters optimizations aimed to improve the performance of the adopted classifiers. The evaluation is performed on a real dataset and the obtained results show good performance.  © 2022 IEEE.;Heart Disease Prediction--Heart Risk Classifiers--Machine Learning;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Digital storage--Diseases--Forecasting--Learning systems--Causes of death--Continuous monitoring--Early diagnosis--Early prediction--Heart disease--Heart disease prediction--Heart risk classifier--Machine-learning--Performance--Prediction of heart disease--Heart;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85132279657

Many machine learning approaches have reached human-level performance in classifying arrhythmia from ECGs. However, these architectures are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can misclassify ECG signals by decreasing the model’s accuracy. Adversarial attacks are small crafted perturbations injected in the original data which manifest the out-of-distribution shifts in signal to misclassify the correct class. Thus, security concerns arise for false hospitalization and insurance fraud abusing these perturbations. To mitigate this problem, we introduce the first novel Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), robust against adversarial attacked ECG signals and retaining high accuracy. Our architecture integrates a new class-weighted objective function for adversarial perturbation identification and new blocks for discerning and combining out-of-distribution shifts in signals in the learning process for accurately classifying various arrhythmia types. Furthermore, we benchmark our architecture on six different white and black-box attacks and compare them with other recently proposed arrhythmia classification models on two publicly available ECG arrhythmia datasets. The experiment confirms that our model is more robust against such adversarial attacks for classifying arrhythmia with high accuracy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Adversarial attack--Deep learning--ECG--Electrocardiogram--Generative Adversarial Network;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Deep learning--Diseases--Generative adversarial networks--Insurance--Learning systems--Network architecture--Adversarial attack--Arrhythmia detection--Deep learning--ECG signals--Electrical disturbances--High-accuracy--Machine learning approaches--Network robustness--Robust systems--Trusted systems--Electrocardiograms;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85140473303

Box 26666, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates;Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a type of cardiac arrhythmia affecting millions of people every year. This disease increases the likelihood of strokes, heart failure, and even death. While dedicated medical-grade electrocardiogram (ECG) devices can enable gold-standard analysis, these devices are expensive and require clinical settings. Recent advances in the capabilities of general-purpose smartphones and wearable technology equipped with photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors in-crease diagnostic accessibility for most populations. This work aims to develop a single model that can generalize AF classification across the modalities of ECG and PPG with a unified knowledge representation. This is enabled by approximating the transformation of signals obtained from low-cost wearable PPG sensors in terms of Pulse Rate Variability (PRV) to temporal Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features extracted from medical-grade ECG. This paper proposes a one-dimensional deep convolutional neural network that uses HRV-derived features for classifying 30-s heart rhythms as normal sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation from both ECG and PPG-based sensors. The model is trained with three MIT-BIH ECG databases and is assessed on a dataset of unseen PPG signals acquired from wrist-worn wearable devices through transfer learning. The model achieved the aggregate binary classification performance measures of accuracy: 95.50%, sensitivity: 94.50%, and specificity: 96.00% across a five-fold cross-validation strategy on the ECG datasets. It also achieved 95.10% accuracy, 94.60% sensitivity, 95.20% specificity on an unseen PPG dataset. The results show considerable promise towards seamless adaptation of gold-standard ECG trained models for non-ambulatory AF detection with consumer wearable devices through HRV-based knowledge transfer. © 2021 by the authors.

Missed detection of CHF and its progression affects life expectancy, thus it is critical to develop applications to continuously monitor CHF symptoms and disease progression in a patient-centric and cost-effective manner. This paper focuses on a novel non-invasive technique to identify CHF using patients' speech traits. Pulmonary congestion and breathlessness is the most common symptom of heart failure and one of the major contributors to hospitalisation. Since pulmonary congestion results in impairment of a patient's voice, we propose a novel, non invasive method for monitoring CHF through analysis of the patient's speech. We also introduce a new balanced dataset, containing voice recordings from both healthy participants and participants diagnosed with CHF, which contains voice alterations reflective of CHF status. We propose a novel deep machine learning architecture based on mode driven memory fusion for CHF recognition from audio recordings of subject's speech. We have achieved 90% accuracy under a subject-independent evaluation setting, highlighting the applicability of such methods for tele-health and home monitoring applications.

In the early 21st century, cardiovascular diseases accounted for nearly 50% of the mortality in developed countries and about 25% in developing countries, and cardiovascular diseases have gradually become common diseases. Accurate prediction of survival events of patients with cardiovascular disease can provide more meaningful reference for subsequent treatment, and strive for the best treatment opportunity for patients to achieve the purpose of prolonging life. The data set collected by Kaggle was used in this study, which included variables such as high blood pressure, creatinine phosphokinase, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, and smoking. Based on Akaike information criterion (AIC), stepwise regression analysis was used to select the strongly correlated variables of cardiovascular disease, and then an artificial neural network (ANN) based survival prediction model of cardiovascular disease was constructed. In this paper, support vector machine (SVM) and naive Bayes are used to compare with the artificial neural network. The results show that the performance of artificial neural network is better than other algorithms regardless of the use of strongly correlated variables. After using strongly correlated variables, the performance of each algorithm is improved. After training the artificial neural network with strong correlation variables, it has the highest accuracy, accuracy, recall rate, F1-score and AUC, which can reach 0.81, 0.83, 0.85, 0.84 and 0.84 respectively. © 2021 IEEE.;cardiovascular disease--deep learning--medical data--survival prediction;Blood--Blood pressure--Blood vessels--Cardiology--Deep learning--Developing countries--Forecasting--Neural networks--Patient treatment--Regression analysis--Support vector machines--Accurate prediction--Cardiovascular disease--Chronic disease--Common disease--Correlated variables--Deep learning--Developed countries--Medical data--Performance--Survival prediction--Diseases;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85118957020

Risk prediction can help incentivize lifestyle changes and inform targeted preventative treatment. In this work we explore utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict cardiovascular disease risk from abdominal CT scans taken for routine CT colonography in otherwise healthy patients aged 50-65. We find that adding a variational autoencoder (VAE) to the CNN classifier improves its accuracy for five year survival prediction (AUC 0.787 vs. 0.768). In four-fold cross validation we obtain an average AUC of 0.787 for predicting five year survival and an AUC of 0.767 for predicting cardiovascular disease. For five year survival prediction our model is significantly better than the Framingham Risk Score (AUC 0.688) and of nearly equivalent performance to method demonstrated in Pickhardt et al.

Previous studies among physicians and paramedics have shown that the accuracy of STEMI diagnosis by the 12-lead ECG is not sufficient. Thus, we propose a 2D-CNN model that can detect and locate the STEMI signals from 12-lead ECG images. The 2D-CNN model is trained as a binary classification with 540 ECG images (270 STEMI cases and 270 other ECG images), and it achieved 96.3% accuracy, 96.2% sensitivity, 89.4% precision, 0.926 F1-score, and 0.962 ROC-AUC scores for 537 testing images. The proposed model is compared with 10 different transfer learning models. The proposed model has the best accuracy, sensitivity, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score. Grad-CAM technique is used for localization of STEMI signals in ECG images. According to the comparisons, the proposed model is the most reliable one for localizing the STEMI signals. This localization builds trust for the model because the CNN model is not a black box anymore, we can see where the CNN model looks and decides. The result of localization can also be used for teaching inexperienced physicians and paramedics. Also, the proposed model can be helpful for the accurate diagnosis of STEMI with a quick response time for clinical practices.  © 2013 IEEE.;Artificial intelligence (AI)--convolutional neural network (CNN)--deep learning--electrocardiogram (ECG)--Grad-CAM--machine learning--myocardial infarction--ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI);Cams--Cardiology--Chemical detection--Convolution--Deep learning--Electrocardiography--Heart--Neural networks--Artificial intelligence--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Electrocardiogram--Features extraction--Grad-CAM--Location awareness--Myocardial Infarction--Myocardium--ST-elevation myocardial infarction--Feature extraction;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85128274621

As a result, cardiovascular diseases are more likely to be addressed as early as possible before affecting the lifespan. Artificial intelligence has taken research on disease diagnosis and identification to another level. Despite several methods and models coming into existence, there is a possibility of improving the classification or forecast accuracy. By selecting the connected combination of models and features, we can improve accuracy. To achieve a better solution, we have proposed a reliable ensemble model in this paper. The proposed model produced results of 96.75% on the cardiovascular disease dataset obtained from the Mendeley Data Center, 93.39% on the comprehensive dataset collected from IEEE DataPort, and 88.24% on data collected from the Cleveland dataset. With this proposed model, we can achieve the safety and health security of an individual.  © 2022 Bhanu Prakash Doppala et al.;;Artificial Intelligence--Cardiovascular Diseases--Humans--Artificial intelligence--Data handling--Diagnosis--Diseases--high density lipoprotein cholesterol--low density lipoprotein cholesterol--Cardiovascular disease--Classification accuracy--Clinical data--Disease diagnosis--Ensemble models--Ensemble techniques--Forecast accuracy--Intelligence models--Lifespans--Machine intelligence--accuracy--angina pectoris--Article--artificial intelligence--artificial neural network--Bayesian learning--cardiovascular disease--cholesterol blood level--classifier--clinical examination--convolutional neural network--coronary artery disease--coronavirus disease 2019--decision making--deep learning--discriminant analysis--female--heart arrest--heart left ventricle hypertrophy--heart rate--human--logistic regression analysis--machine learning--male--medical practice--multilayer perceptron--performance indicator--prediction--principal component analysis--random forest--support vector machine--transfer of learning--cardiovascular disease--Cardiology;Hindawi Limited;35299686;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85126658551

One of the major health issues that are very predominant among majority of human community is heart related diseases. This is mainly due to the food habits, life style, and lack of health awareness. Precise and exact diagnosis, prediction is indispensable for such heart diseases because even the slight neglecting leads to critical health complexity results in person demise. So, appropriate system is highly needed to detect the symptoms of such heart diseases in the earlier stage so that suitable treatment must be given to ensure the proper functioning of heart. Machine learning and deep learning technology provides positive acceleration to the health sector by its accurate and precise prediction of such diseases at the earlier stage from the massive health care data. The key focus of this article is to explore the major symptoms of such heart diseases, successful machine learning and deep learning models for the prediction of such diseases and available public dataset. © 2022 IEEE.;Cardiovascular Diseases--Deep Learning--Health--Heart Diseases--Heart Stroke--Machine Learning;Cardiology--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Forecasting--Learning systems--Cardiovascular disease--Community IS--Deep learning--Food habit--Health issues--Heart disease--Heart stroke--Human communities--Life styles--Machine-learning--Heart;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85133195706

Portugal, 1155, St. Marista, Goiânia, GO, Brazil--Federal University of Goias, Alameda Palmeiras, Quadra D, Câmpus Samambaia, Goiânia, GO, Brazil;The echocardiogram is a test that is widely used in Heart Disease Diagnoses. However, its analysis is largely dependent on the physician's experience. In this regard, artificial intelligence has become an essential technology to assist physicians. This study is a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of primary state-of-the-art studies that used Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to automate echocardiogram analyses. Searches on the leading scientific article indexing platforms using a search string returned approximately 1400 articles. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 118 articles were selected to compose the detailed SLR. This SLR presents a thorough investigation of AI applied to support medical decisions for the main types of echocardiogram (Transthoracic, Transesophageal, Doppler, Stress, and Fetal). The article's data extraction indicated that the primary research interest of the studies comprised four groups: 1) Improvement of image quality--2) identification of the cardiac window vision plane--3) quantification and analysis of cardiac functions, and--4) detection and classification of cardiac diseases. The articles were categorized and grouped to show the main contributions of the literature to each type of ECHO. The results indicate that the Deep Learning (DL) methods presented the best results for the detection and segmentation of the heart walls, right and left atrium and ventricles, and classification of heart diseases using images/videos obtained by echocardiography. The models that used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and its variations showed the best results for all groups. The evidence produced by the results presented in the tabulation of the studies indicates that the DL contributed significantly to advances in echocardiogram automated analysis processes. Although several solutions were presented regarding the automated analysis of ECHO, this area of research still has great potential for further studies to improve the accuracy of results already known in the literature. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.;Deep Learning--Echocardiogram--Echocardiography--Machine Learning;Artificial Intelligence--Echocardiography--Neural Networks, Computer--Cardiology--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Echocardiography--Heart--Image analysis--Image enhancement--Image segmentation--Medical imaging--Automated analysis--Classification of heart disease--Heart disease diagnosis--Inclusion and exclusions--Medical decision making--Research interests--Scientific articles--Systematic literature review (SLR)--aortic valve disease--artificial intelligence--autoanalysis--cardiac imaging--cardiac resynchronization therapy--congestive heart failure--convolutional neural network--data extraction--deep learning--disease classification--Doppler echocardiography--echocardiography--fetus--fetus echography--heart disease--heart function--heart left atrium--heart left ventricle ejection fraction--heart left ventricle hypertrophy--heart left ventricle volume--heart movement--heart right atrium--human--image analysis--image quality--medical decision making--mitral valve disease--Review--stress echocardiography--systematic review--transesophageal echocardiography--transthoracic echocardiography--tricuspid valve disease--videorecording--echocardiography--Quality control;Elsevier B.V.;34629153;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85115231542

Early detection can be done through computer aided analysis using the data obtained from Phonocardiogram (PCG) auscultation obtained from a stethoscope. This paper takes five PCG signals - normal, artifact, murmur, extra systole and extrahls that are obtained as datasets from Peter J Bently Challenge.

The diagnosis is often made using electrocardiographic (ECG) signals but manual ECG interpretation by experts is expensive and time-consuming. In this work, we developed and validated an arrhythmia classification model based on handcrafted features, which was more computationally efficient than traditional deep learning models. Material and method: The classification model comprised (i) a specific feature extraction function based on the homeomorphically irreducible tree (HIT) graph pattern, (ii) multilevel feature generation based on maximum absolute pooling, (iii) Chi2 feature selector, and (iv) standard support vector machine classifier. We trained and validated the model on a large dataset comprising 12-leads ECGs acquired from more than 10,000 subjects. Performance metrics were reported for seven- (Case 1) and four-class (Case 2) arrhythmia diagnosis. Results: High classification accuracy rates of 92.95% and 97.18% were attained for Case 1 and Case 2, respectively, that were comparable with those of deep learning on the same ECG dataset. Conclusion: The model achieved excellent classification results at low computational cost, which underscores the potential for real world application of the proposed HIT-based ECG classification model. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.;Automated arrhythmia detection--Chi2 feature selection--ECG--Homeomorphically irreducible tree pattern--Maximum absolute pooling;Classification (of information)--Computer aided diagnosis--Deep learning--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Forestry--Large dataset--Support vector machines--Trees (mathematics)--Arrhythmia classification--Arrhythmia detection--Automated arrhythmia detection--Chi2 feature selection--Classification models--Clinical problems--Electrocardiographic--Homeomorphically irreducible tree pattern--Maximum absolute pooling--Model-based OPC--Feature extraction;Elsevier Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85109379173

EF is estimated from cardiac ultrasound videos known as echocardiograms (echo) by manually tracing the left ventricle and estimating its volume on certain frames. These estimations exhibit high inter-observer variability due to the manual process and varying video quality. Such sources of inaccuracy and the need for rapid assessment necessitate reliable and explainable machine learning techniques. In this work, we introduce EchoGNN, a model based on graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate EF from echo videos. Our model first infers a latent echo-graph from the frames of one or multiple echo cine series. It then estimates weights over nodes and edges of this graph, indicating the importance of individual frames that aid EF estimation. A GNN regressor uses this weighted graph to predict EF. We show, qualitatively and quantitatively, that the learned graph weights provide explainability through identification of critical frames for EF estimation, which can be used to determine when human intervention is required. On EchoNet-Dynamic public EF dataset, EchoGNN achieves EF prediction performance that is on par with state of the art and provides explainability, which is crucial given the high inter-observer variability inherent in this task.

León, Guanajuato, 37320, Mexico--Department of Health Sciences, Universidad Tecnológica de México (UNITEC) Campus León, León, 37200, Mexico;The automatic detection of coronary stenosis is a very important task in computer aided diagnosis systems in the cardiology area. The main contribution of this paper is the identification of a suitable subset of 20 features that allows for the classification of stenosis cases in X-ray coronary images with a high performance overcoming different state-of-the-art classification techniques including deep learning strategies. The automatic feature selection stage was driven by the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm and carried out by statistical comparison between five metaheuristics in order to explore the search space, which is O(249 ) computational complexity. Moreover, the proposed method is compared with six state-of-the-art classification methods, probing its effectiveness in terms of the Accuracy and Jaccard Index evaluation metrics. All the experiments were performed using two X-ray image databases of coronary angiograms. The first database contains 500 instances and the second one 250 images. In the experimental results, the proposed method achieved an Accuracy rate of 0.89 and 0.88 and Jaccard Index of 0.80 and 0.79, respectively. Finally, the average computational time of the proposed method to classify stenosis cases was ≈0.02 s, which made it highly suitable to be used in clinical practice. © 2021 by the authors.

It has been frequently applied in healthcare to optimise diagnostic classification through discovery of hidden patterns in data that may not be obvious to clinicians. Congenital Heart Defect (CHD) machine learning research entails one of the most promising clinical applications, in which timely and accurate diagnosis is essential. The objective of this scoping review is to summarise the application and clinical utility of machine learning techniques used in paediatric cardiology research, specifically focusing on approaches aiming to optimise diagnosis and assessment of underlying CHD. Out of 50 full-text articles identified between 2015 and 2021, 40% focused on optimising the diagnosis and assessment of CHD. Deep learning and support vector machine were the most commonly used algorithms, accounting for an overall diagnostic accuracy > 0.80. Clinical applications primarily focused on the classification of auscultatory heart sounds, transthoracic echocardiograms, and cardiac MRIs. The range of these applications and directions of future research are discussed in this scoping review. © 2021 Cambridge University Press.

Most patients cannot be diagnosed at the early stage because it does not give any symptoms for many years. If CHD gets worse, it will require advanced treatments, such as heart transplant and stent surgery. Therefore, it is useful in preventing CHD by predicting high-risk people who will suffer from CHD. In this study, we have proposed a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based deep neural network (DNN) model for predicting CHD risk. We improved the performance of DNN model by enriching training dataset using VAE-based data generation. The proposed method has been compared with machine learning algorithms on Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) dataset. As a result, the proposed method outperformed the compared classifiers. The performance measurements include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC score which reached 0.851, 0.882, 0.809%, 0.844, and 0.851, respectively. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;Coronary heart disease--Deep neural network--Machine learning--Variational autoencoder;Cardiology--Diseases--Forecasting--Heart--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Neural network models--Advanced treatment--Auto encoders--Coronary heart disease--Disease risks--Heart transplant--Machine-learning--Neural network model--Performance--Risk predictions--Variational autoencoder--Deep neural networks;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85135009356

Many individuals worldwide die each year from cardiovascular disease. Since heart disease is a major concern, it must be dealt with timely. Multiple variables affecting health, such as excessive blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, an irregular pulse rate, and many more, make it challenging to diagnose cardiac disease. Thus, artificial intelligence can be useful in identifying and treating diseases early on. This paper proposes an ensemble-based approach that uses machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to predict a person's likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease. We employ six classification algorithms to predict cardiovascular disease. Models are trained using a publicly available dataset of cardiovascular disease cases.

One of the developments that have been carried out is to minimize the number of inspections carried out. Unfortunately, many features selection models do not consider the cost of inspection, so the result of feature selection is an average inspection that requires high costs. This study proposes an intelligence system model for the diagnosis of coronary heart disease using a feature selection model that considers the cost of the examination. Feature selection is developed using a genetic algorithm and support vector machine. Decision-making of the diagnosis system is carried out using a deep neural network, with system performance being measured using the parameters of accuracy, sensitivity, positive predictive value, and area under the curve (AUC). The test results use the z-Alizadeh sani model feature selection dataset which produces 5 features out of 54 existing features. The use of these 5 features can produce AUC performance of 93.7%, accuracy of 87.7%, and sensitivity of 87.7%. Referring to the resulting performance, it shows that the feature selection model by considering the cost of an inspection can provide performance in the very good category.  © 2013 IEEE.;Coronary artery disease--deep neural network--feature selection--genetic algorithm--machine learning;Bioinformatics--Cardiology--Computer aided diagnosis--Costs--Decision making--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Forecasting--Genetic algorithms--Heart--Learning algorithms--Statistical tests--Support vector machines--Biological cells--Coronary artery disease--Coronary heart disease--Diagnose system--Ensemble learning--Features extraction--Features selection--Intelligence systems--Performance--Selection model--Feature extraction;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85126335678

Therefore, in order for convenient real-time MI detection, it is essential to design lightweight models suitable for resource-limited portable devices. This paper proposes a novel multi-channel lightweight model (ML-Net), that provides a new solution for portable detection devices with limited resources. In ML-Net, each electrocardiogram (ECG) lead is assigned an independent channel, ensuring data independence and preserve the ECG characteristics of different angles represented by different leads. Moreover, convolution kernels of heterogeneous sizes are utilized to achieve accurate classification with only a small amount of lead data. Extensive experiments over actual ECG data from the PTB diagnostic database are conducted to evaluate ML-Net. The results show that ML-Net outperforms comparable schemes in diagnosing MI, and it requires lower computational cost and less memory, so that portable devices can be more widely used in the field of Internet of Medical Things(IoMT). © 2013 IEEE.;Convolutional neural network--internet of medical things--multi-channel lightweight network--myocardial infarction--portable mobile devices;Algorithms--Databases, Factual--Electrocardiography--Humans--Myocardial Infarction--Neural Networks, Computer--Cardiology--Electrocardiography--Portable equipment--Automatic diagnosis--Computational costs--Convolution kernel--Data independence--Diagnostic database--Independent channels--Myocardial Infarction--Storage capacity--Article--artificial neural network--controlled study--deep learning--diagnostic accuracy--diagnostic test accuracy study--electrocardiogram--feature extraction--heart infarction--heart rate variability--human--image analysis--independent component analysis--internet of medical thing--internet of things--k nearest neighbor--kernel method--machine learning--major clinical study--mathematical computing--multi channel lightweight network--performance--principal component analysis--recursive neural network--support vector machine--algorithm--electrocardiography--factual database--heart infarction--Digital storage;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;33606647;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85101767358

This is a very big health issue in the world and is addressed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and can be seen from the statistics that have been provided by the organization and is very much approved by the other organizations too. The symptoms that are shown by the patients who are suffering from the stroke disease or which are very much prone to the stroke disease and may suffer from a very chronic stroke disease show heart disease, declination of metabolism and problems in the artilleries. The main issue due to which this problem is occurring is due to the flow of the blood, which is not able to reach the part of the heart through which the cleaning of the blood takes place or in other words the carbon dioxide is taken out of the blood and the oxygen is given which purifies the blood and is sent to the other body parts. In this medical industry, there are many machine learning and deep learning methods that are incorporated by the research community and different novelties have been researched by the community. By the method proposed, we could mitigate the strokes occurring by approximately 96% of the items from the data received from the patient. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;Machine learning--Predictive modelling--Random forest classifier--Stroke prediction;Blood--Carbon dioxide--Cardiology--Decision trees--Deep learning--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Chronic stroke--Health issues--Heart disease--Machine learning algorithms--Machine-learning--Prediction systems--Predictive models--Random forest classifier--Stroke prediction--World Health Organization--Diseases;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Book chapter;Scopus;2-s2.0-85134603838

They are difficult to be predicted by a specialist physician as it is not an easy task which requires greater knowledge and expertise for prediction. With the variety of machine learning and deep learning algorithms, there exist many recent studies in the state of the art that have been done remarkable and practical works for predicting the presence of heart diseases. However, some of these works were affected by various drawbacks. Hence, this work aims to compare and analyze different classifiers, pre-processing, and dimensionality reduction techniques (feature selection and feature extraction) and study their effect on the prediction of heart diseases existence. Therefore, based on the resulting performance of several conducted experiments on the well-known Cleveland heart disease dataset, the findings of this study are: 1) the most significant subset of features to predict the existence of heart diseases are PES, EIA, CPT, MHR, THA, VCA, and OPK, 2) Naïve Bayes classifier gave the best performance prediction, and 3) Chi-squared feature selection was the data mining technique that reduced the number of features while maintained the same improved performance for predicting the presence of heart disease. © 2022.

Specifically, in the case of in-hospital complications following acute myocardial infarction (AMI), even with decreased in-hospital mortality rate due to improved hospital care, patients who survive the acute phase of MI remain at risk for MI-associated complications or recurrent AMI such as bundle branch blocks and angina. In this paper, we propose a multi-label framework to predict the occurrence of 5 complications following admission of 1,700 patients after suffering an AMI episode. We evaluate the models using several multi-label prediction metrics as a test of robustness of our method beating numerous other alternatives and comment on the balance of cost-effectiveness of a compact deep learning model versus shallow machine learning in the multi-label context. Our neural network outperformed 13 other algorithms across all metrics, except Hamming loss. We also implement Shapley value analysis to this multi-label problem and observe interesting behaviour such as the duration of arterial hypertension and time elapsed from the beginning of the attack to the hospital being key predictive features of lethal outcome. This framework presents a novel approach in using multi-label learning, and especially compact cost-effective deep learning, simultaneous for prediction of several AMI complications which has not been explored previously.  © 2022 IEEE.;complications--digital health--explainability--machine learning--multi-label learning--myocardial infarction--re-sampling;Cardiology--Cost effectiveness--Deep learning--E-learning--Forecasting--Learning systems--Acute myocardial infarction--Complication--Digital health--Explainability--Machine-learning--Multi-label learning--Multi-labels--Myocardial Infarction--Neural modelling--Resampling--Hospitals;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85143063769

The aware of the status of a person via the testing of numerous metrics, as well as the inference of a positive outcome from the past of this kind of continuous supervision, distinguishes the Internet of Things inside the medical system. A difficult endeavor, the prognosis of cardiovascular disease survival is important in assisting medical practitioners in making the best judgments possible for their individuals. Patients with heart failure need the knowledge and skill of health doctors to be properly cared for. The use of machine learning techniques may aid in the comprehension of the signs of cardiovascular disease. Hand - crafted feature development, on the other hand, is difficult and necessitates the use of specialized knowledge to determine the most suited approach. This research presents a smart health monitoring structure that makes use of the Internet of Things and cloud mechanism to enhance the mortality forecast of patients with chronic heart failure with no need for human classifier, as previously done. In addition, the smart IoT-based infrastructure analyzes individuals just on based entirely information and offers cardiac rehabilitation with fast, efficient, and high-quality medical care. Additionally, the suggested model analyses whether deep learning models are effective in distinguishing between heart failure patients who are alive and those who are died. The framework makes use of Internet of Things-based sensors to collect signals and transmit them to a cloud web application for analysis. Learning algorithms are used to further analyse these data in order to identify the condition of the patients. Health information and process monitoring are communicated with a medical expert who will respond to the patient in the event that emergency assistance is necessary. The dataset utilized in this research comprises 13 characteristics and was obtained from the Cardiovascular Disease Clinical Records repository at the University of California, Irvine.

In addition, time is another important feature that affects clinical choices for accurate predictions. When there is a sickness in the body, the human body offers symptoms in the form of discomfort, changes in bodily parameters, changes in habits, and a variety of other changes. These changes are frequently assessed in order to detect a specific type of sickness. For example, Fluctuations in the blood glucose level is used to identify diabetes, whereas variations in the electrocardiogram signals are used to detect heart disease and other cardiac diseases. Although these diseases are frequently linked to one another, developing a crossover parametric model for each of them can help to improve the precision with which they are recognized. For example, analyzing the influence of fluctuations in blood sugar levels can be connected to the identification of cancer because long-term glucose consumption weakens the body and consequently diminishes its immune system's effectiveness. This decline in immunity causes a reduction in red blood cells, making the body more susceptible to malignancy. Many cases of cross parameter illness detection have been investigated over the years, and the results have been promising. Here several systems are compared which perform cross-analysis of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. It first tests different cross-body parameter links between these diseases, and then tests the classification efficiency of a several machine learning/deep learning algorithms for detection of diseases by using cross-body parameters tested earlier. When compared to non-cross parametric techniques, it has been discovered that the system increases the accuracy of detection of various disease. In this paper we have examined few papers according to their methods, styles, actions, and procedures. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2022.;body parameters--cross-parameter--disease--disease prediction--immunity--machine learning--network--neural;Blood--Cardiology--Diseases--Glucose--Learning algorithms--Machine learning--Body parameters--Condition prediction--Cross-parameter--Disease prediction--Empirical surveys--Health condition--Immunity--Machine-learning--Network--Neural--Forecasting;Grenze Scientific Society;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85143349364

These cardiac arrhythmias cause heart strokes and other heart complications leading to an increased risk of heart failure. Early and accurate cardiac arrhythmia detection is vital to preventing various heart-related diseases. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a popular and reliable method to detect cardiac arrhythmia and heart-related diseases. However, sometimes, it becomes difficult and time-consuming to interpret the ECG signal, even for a cardiac expert. This study proposes a deep learning-based method to effectively classify and detect cardiac arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation) using a time-frequency (TF) spectrogram of ECG records. The proposed framework utilizes superlet transform (SLT) to transform the 1-D ECG signal into a 2-D TF spectrogram. The last layer of the pretrained convolutional neural networks, namely, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and DenseNet, is modified and then used to classify the ECG records into healthy heart, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular fibrillation. The proposed method is tested using ECG signals from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, the MIT-BIH malignant database, the Fantasia database, the AF termination challenge database, and the CU ventricular tachyarrhythmia database. The proposed method with DenseNet-201 architecture provides the best performance with an overall test accuracy of 96.2%.

However, the majority of these approaches are restricted to feature preprocessing. In this paper, we concentrate on both, including, feature refinement and the removal of the predictive model's problems, e.g., underfitting and overfitting. By evading overfitting and underfitting, the model will demonstrate good enactment on equally the training and testing datasets. Overfitting the training data is often triggered by inadequate network configuration and inappropriate features. We advocate using Chi2 statistical model to remove irrelevant features when searching for the best-configured gated recurrent unit (GRU) using an exhaustive search strategy. The suggested hybrid technique, called Chi2 GRU, is tested against traditional ANN and GRU models, as well as different progressive machine learning models and antecedently revealed strategies for cardiopathy prediction. The prediction accuracy of proposed model is 92.17%. In contrast to formerly stated approaches, the obtained outcomes are promising. The study's results indicate that medical practitioner will use the proposed diagnostic method to reliably predict heart disease.  © 2022 - IOS Press.

Due to the limited scalability in terms of security concerns of cloud computing, the need for a centralized IoTs based environment has been constrained to a limited extent. The sensitivity of device latency emerged during healthy systems such as health monitoring, etc. is the main reason, because healthy systems require computing operations on high-volume data. Fog computing provides an innovative solution to improve the performance of cloud computing, providing the ability to take the necessary resources and those that are closer to the end-users. Existing fog computing models retain several limitations, such as either considering result accuracy or overestimating response time, but managing both together impairs system compatibility. FETCH is a proposed framework that integrates with edge computing devices to work on deep learning technology and automated monitoring and offers a highly useful framework for real-life health care systems such as heart disease and more. The proposed Fog-enabled cloud computing framework uses FogBus, which demonstrates utility in the form of consumption of power, network bandwidth, jitter, latency, process execution time, and their accuracy as well.  © 2013 IEEE.;deep learning (DL)--edge computing--Fog computing--healthcare--heart disease analysis--Internet of Things (IoT)--machine learning (ML);Cardiology--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Edge computing--Fog--Health care--Internet of things--Cloud-computing--Deep learning--Disease analysis--Edge computing--Heart disease--Heart disease analyse--Integrated environment--Internet of thing--Machine learning--Machine-learning--Fog computing;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85123296297

In order to diagnose Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the popular instruments. In recent times, ECG monitoring systems are exponentially increasing. As a result, it is very difficult for the scientists and health experts to choose, compare and evaluate the systems, and identify which will meet their needs and necessary monitoring. In this research article, we offer a global taxonomy and review from an expert of ECG surveillance systems. It provides support, which is an evidence to monitor components, contexts, functions and challenges. For monitoring the ECG systems, an architectural model is proposed in this paper and provides in-depth review. In this research paper, an adaptive medium filter is used for signal preprocessing and the segmentation is accomplished using watershed transform.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), in particular, are the main cause of death worldwide, accounting for 30% of all fatalities in the United States and 45% in Europe. Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models are playing an important role in the advancement of heart failure therapy. The main objective of this study was to perform a network meta-analysis of patients with heart failure, stroke, hypertension, and diabetes by comparing the ML and DL models. A comprehensive search of five electronic databases was performed using ScienceDirect, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore. The search strategy was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. The methodological quality of studies was assessed by following the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) guidelines. The random-effects network meta-analysis forest plot with categorical data was used, as were subgroups testing for all four types of treatments and calculating odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Pooled network forest, funnel plots, and the league table, which show the best algorithms for each outcome, were analyzed. Seventeen studies, with a total of 285,213 patients with CVDs, were included in the network meta-analysis. The statistical evidence indicated that the DL algorithms performed well in the prediction of heart failure with AUC of 0.843 and CI [0.840-0.845], while in the ML algorithm, the gradient boosting machine (GBM) achieved an average accuracy of 91.10% in predicting heart failure. An artificial neural network (ANN) performed well in the prediction of diabetes with an OR and CI of 0.0905 [0.0489--0.1673]. Support vector machine (SVM) performed better for the prediction of stroke with OR and CI of 25.0801 [11.4824--54.7803]. Random forest (RF) results performed well in the prediction of hypertension with OR and CI of 10.8527 [4.7434--24.8305]. The findings of this work suggest that the DL models can effectively advance the prediction of and knowledge about heart failure, but there is a lack of literature regarding DL methods in the field of CVDs. As a result, more DL models should be applied in this field. To confirm our findings, more meta-analysis (e.g., Bayesian network) and thorough research with a larger number of patients are encouraged. © 2022 Yahia Baashar et al.;;Artificial Intelligence--Bayes Theorem--Cardiovascular Diseases--Female--Humans--Machine Learning--Male--Network Meta-Analysis--Decision trees--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Forecasting--Heart--Neural networks--Random processes--Support vector machines--Cardiovascular disease--Causes of death--Confidence interval--Electronic database--Heart failure--Intelligence models--Learning models--Meta-analysis--Odd ratios--Web of Science--artificial intelligence--Bayes theorem--cardiovascular disease--female--human--machine learning--male--meta analysis--network meta-analysis--Cardiology;Hindawi Limited;35251153;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85125881344

Machine learning is one of them, and deep learning is one of those machine learning techniques. The application of AI in healthcare systems including hospitals and clinics has many possible advantages and future prospects. Applications of AI in cardiovascular medicine are machine learning techniques for diagnostic procedures including imaging modalities and biomarkers and predictive analytics for personalized therapies and improved outcomes. In cardiovascular medicine, AI-based systems have found new applications in risk prediction for cardiovascular diseases, in cardiovascular imaging, in predicting outcomes after revascularization procedures, and in newer drug targets. AI such as machine learning has partially resolved and provided possible solutions to unmet requirements in interventional cardiology. Predicting economically vital endpoints, predictive models with a wide range of health factors including comorbidities, socioeconomic factors, and angiographic factors comprising of the size of stents, the volume of contrast agent which was infused during angiography, stent malposition, and so on have been possible owing to machine learning and AI. Nowadays, machine learning techniques might possibly help in the identification of patients at risk, with higher morbidity and mortality following acute coronary syndrome (ACS). AI through machine learning has shown several potential benefits in patients with ACS. From diagnosis to treatment effects to predicting adverse events and mortality in patients with ACS, machine learning should find an essential place in clinical medicine and in interventional cardiology for the treatment and management of patients with ACS.

Specifically, video monitoring can significantly improve the monitoring of atrial fibrillation--a prevalent and growing cardiac disease affecting millions around the world. We propose and investigate the performance of a deep learning classifier for the detection of atrial fibrillation. We compare the performance of the proposed classifier with a benchmark of five existing classifiers based on traditional signal processing and machine learning. In addition, we compare performance across various sensing modalities, including a high-end camera, a webcam, an earlobe oximeter, and an electrocardiogram holter. To this end, we conduct a clinical study with 55 atrial fibrillation patients in a hospital setting. Results show that the proposed classifier outperforms the benchmark, especially when using a low-cost webcam, and provides consistently accurate detection when applied to an electrocardiogram, a photo plethysmography sensor, and two video camera sensors, thereby placing video monitoring on par with its contract-based counterparts. © 2022 IEEE.;;Benchmarking--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Monitoring--Signal processing--Video cameras--Atrial fibrillation--Cardiac disease--Condition--Learning classifiers--Non-contact monitoring--Performance--Signal machines--Signal-processing--Video monitoring--WebCams--Electrocardiograms;IEEE Computer Society;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85137769745

Box 800, Riyadh, 11421, Saudi Arabia--Centre for Smart Systems, AI and Cybersecurity, Staffordshire University, Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom;Hypertension is the main cause of blood pressure (BP), which further causes various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The recent COVID-19 pandemic raised the burden on the healthcare system and also limits the resources to these patients only. The treatment of chronic patients, especially those who suffer from CVD, has fallen behind, resulting in increased deaths from CVD around the world. Regular monitoring of BP is crucial to prevent CVDs as it can be controlled and diagnosed through constant monitoring. To find an effective and convenient procedure for the early diagnosis of CVDs, photoplethysmography (PPG) is recognized as a low-cost technology. Through PPG technology, various cardiovascular parameters, including blood pressure, heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, etc., are detected. Merging the healthcare domain with information technology (IT) is a demanding area to reduce the rehospitalization of CVD patients. In the proposed model, PPG signals from the Internet of things (IoT)-enabled wearable patient monitoring (WPM) devices are used to monitor the heart rate (HR), etc., of the patients remotely. This article investigates various machine learning techniques such as decision tree (DT), naïve Bayes (NB), and support vector machine (SVM) and the deep learning model one-dimensional convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (1D CNN-LSTM) to develop a system that assists physicians during continuous monitoring, which achieved an accuracy of 99.5% using PPG-BP data set. The proposed system provides cost-effective, efficient, and fully connected monitoring systems for cardiac patients.  © 2022 Tariq Sadad et al.;;Bayes Theorem--Cardiovascular Diseases--Cloud Computing--COVID-19--Humans--Machine Learning--Pandemics--Photoplethysmography--Blood--Blood pressure--Cardiology--Convolutional neural networks--Decision trees--Diseases--Heart--Internet of things--Learning systems--Long short-term memory--Patient monitoring--Patient treatment--Support vector machines--Blood oxygen saturation--Cardiovascular disease--Cardiovascular parameters--Cloud-computing--Early diagnosis--Healthcare domains--Healthcare systems--Heart-rate--Low-cost technology--Machine-learning--Bayes theorem--cardiovascular disease--cloud computing--human--machine learning--pandemic--photoelectric plethysmography--procedures--Cost effectiveness;Hindawi Limited;35965760;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85136012216

Former research demonstrates the remarkable accuracy of AI to aid physicians to settle on better clinical choices or supplant judgment made by human beings, in particular, technical and practical areas of medical care. Statistics indicate that the shortage of doctors in therapeutically under-resourced regions and the lack of availability of skilled physicians in highly engaged clinical settings tend to cause a rise in false detection rates. The excessive workload causes fatigue that could lead to poor recovery of diseases. AI is ever-evolving as it is making advancements at an exponential rate, especially in healthcare treatments, such as monitoring treatments, improving the planning, and analyzing data to provide better treatment plans. The procedure of data accumulation, data management, clustering, and tagging invites numerous governance and regulatory challenges that could take a long duration. The healthcare industry thrives in this unending battle as the complexity and intricacy of data, and strict guidelines take a major toll. A healthcare institute is subjected to ask for consent from an institutional review board’s work to attenuate a portion of these concerns, and researchers and scientists may measure, process, and anonymize DICOM information to strip away any patient’s medical information. The AI-enabled medical care employed in the institutes plays an imperative role as an informative assistant that provides aid to doctors in acquiring an understanding of meaningful patterns from data collection. This practice holds the potential to save a lot of time, cost, and effort while yielding consistent, unbiased, and prime diagnosis or treatment. AI and deep learning (DL) tools used in day-to-day medical decision-making have a grave impact on improving the patient’s treatment and overall cost incurred due to their employment efficiency and accuracy. AI and machine learning (ML) can prove to be of supreme importance and assistance in the early detection and thus the prevention of a plethora of diseases by reading and analyzing the patient’s vitals. The presented chapter is of 5-folds. First, the distinct data sources where the healthcare data is gathered from are discussed. Second, we talk about the moral and lawful difficulties of AI-driven medical care. Next, the structured and unstructured types of healthcare data have been analyzed followed by the AI techniques applied to these types of data, such as ML, natural language processing (NLP), and DL.We then analyze the crucial disease areas such as cardiology, radiology, neurology, and cancer, where the health issues can be alleviated by employing AI techniques.

The literature search used search engines including PubMed, Hindawi, SCOPUS, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Wiley Online, Jstor, Taylor and Francis, Ebscohost, and ScienceDirect. This study focused on four aspects: Machine Learning Algorithms, datasets, best-performing algorithms, and software used in coronary heart disease (CHD) predictions. The empirical articles never mentioned 'Reinforcement Learning,' a promising aspect of Machine Learning. Ensemble algorithms showed reasonable accuracy rates but were not common, whereas deep neural networks were poorly represented. Only a few papers applied primary datasets (4 of 37). Logistic Regression (LR), Deep Neural Network (DNN), K-Means, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and boosting algorithms were the best performing algorithms.

By studying data such as cholesterol levels, blood sugar, and blood pressure, heart disease can be predicted. In recent years, several machine learning techniques have been used to aid in fast prediction by learning from the data. However, the prediction accuracy still remains low. This is due to lower number of records contained in the databases available. In this paper, we propose a new method of heart disease prediction using a modified variation of infinite feature selection and multilayer perceptron. The method shows a high accuracy of 87.70%, a high F1-score of 87.21%, a high sensitivity of 88.50%, a high specificity of 87.02%, and a high precision in prediction of 86.05%. on the Cleveland, Hungarian, Switzerland, Long Beach, and Statlog datasets.

Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) is one of the most common assessments of cardiovascular disease. Manually detecting stenoses over the complete coronary artery tree of each patient takes an expert about 10 min. Previous works about automated detection of plaques required carefully controlling parameters of region-based segmentation algorithms or hand-craft features extraction for machine learning algorithms. Current works presented the feasibility of deep learning algorithms for plaque and stenosis detection. This study aims to develop an efficient workflow for detecting plaques and classification using a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN). Based on a fully convolutional structure, our model has better stability than recurrent layers at the training stage. Furthermore, our method is efficient since the model takes only cross-sectional planes (CSP) images as the input, rather than including other views containing replicate information. For each patient, it takes less than 25 s to perform the whole workflow. The first step of our workflow is to extract CSP images on each control point of a given set of coronary artery centerlines. We then stack several contiguous CSP images together to form a 3D volume, which is the input of the CNN model. The model will predict the type of plaque (soft, mixed, or calcified) at each control point. With this information, we can not only detect the precise location of plaques but also summarize the existence of plaque in each artery segment. In addition, we consider the lumen radius estimation as the next step to approach stenosis detection. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Convolutional neural network (CNN)--Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA)--Coronary plaque;Angiography--Computerized tomography--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Diseases--Heart--Image segmentation--Learning algorithms--Cardiovascular disease--Computed tomography angiography--Convolutional neural network--Coronary arteries--Coronary computed tomography angiography--Coronary plaques--Stenoses--Stenosis detection--Work-flows--Cardiology;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85124026052

Oral anticoagulation reduces the risk of thromboembolic stroke in those at higher risk--but for a number of patients, stroke is the first manifestation of undetected AF. There is a rationale for the early diagnosis of AF, before the first complication occurs, but population-based screening is not recommended. Previous prediction models have been limited by their data sources and methodologies. An accurate model that uses existing routinely collected data is needed to inform clinicians of patient-level risk of AF, inform national screening policy and highlight predictors that may be amenable to primary prevention. Methods and analysis We will investigate the application of a range of deep learning techniques, including an adapted convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network and Transformer, on routinely collected primary care data to create a personalised model predicting the risk of new-onset AF over a range of time periods. The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)-GOLD dataset will be used for derivation, and the CPRD-AURUM dataset will be used for external geographical validation. Both comprise a sizeable representative population and are linked at patient-level to secondary care databases. The performance of the deep learning models will be compared against classic machine learning and traditional statistical predictive modelling methods. We will only use risk factors accessible in primary care and endow the model with the ability to update risk prediction as it is presented with new data, to make the model more useful in clinical practice. Ethics and dissemination Permissions for CPRD-GOLD and CPRD-AURUM datasets were obtained from CPRD (ref no: 19_076). The CPRD ethical approval committee approved the study. The results will be submitted as a research paper for publication to a peer-reviewed journal and presented at peer-reviewed conferences.

Some severe arrhythmias can even threaten human life. An electrocardiogram (ECG) records the changes in electrical activity generated during each cardiac cycle of the heart, which can reflect the human cardiac health status and help diagnose arrhythmias. However, because of the brevity of conventional ECGs, arrhythmias, which occasionally occur in daily life, cannot be detected easily. Automatic ECG analysis-based long-term heartbeat monitoring is of great significance for the effective detection of accidental arrhythmias and then for taking indispensable measures to prevent cardiovascular diseases in time. An ensemble extreme learning machine (ELM) approach for heartbeat classification that fuses handcrafted features and deep features was proposed. The manually extracted features clearly characterize the heartbeat signal, where RR interval features reflect the time-domain characteristic, and the wavelet coefficient features reflect the time-frequency characteristic. A 1D convolutional neural network (1D CNN) was designed to automatically extract deep features for heartbeat signals. These features were fused by an ELM for heartbeat classification. Because of the instability caused by the random assignment of ELM hidden layer parameters, the bagging ensemble strategy was introduced to integrate multiple ELMs to achieve stable classification performance and good generalization ability. The proposed approach was validated on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia public dataset.

The use of electrocardiograms (ECGs) is a vital part of diagnosing these conditions. These signals are used to collect information about the heart's rhythm. Currently, various limitations prevent the diagnosis of heart diseases. The BiDLNet model is proposed in this paper which aims to examine the capability of electrocardiogram data to diagnose heart disease. Through a combination of deep learning techniques and structural design, BiDLNet can extract two levels of features from the data. A discrete wavelet transform is a process that takes advantage of the features extracted from higher layers and then adds them to lower layers. An ensemble classification scheme is then made to combine the predictions of various deep learning models. The BiDLNet system can classify features of different types of heart disease using two classes of classification: binary and multiclass. It performed remarkably well in achieving an accuracy of 97.5% and 91.5%, respectively. © 2022.

Lately, wearable devices have turned famous with extensive implementations in health monitory system that has accelerated the development of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). IoMT possesses a significant function to perform in lessening the fatality rate by initial diagnosis of illness. The prediction of heart illness remains the main problem in assessing the medical dataset. The proposed study's goal is to identify key characteristics of heart disease prediction using machine learning techniques. Several research works have concentrated on heart illness detection, yet the precision of the outcome is poor. Hence, for enhancing the prediction precision, an IoMT architecture employing Recurrent CONVoluted neural networks (Rec-CONVnet) is proffered for the detection of heart illness. Rec-CONVnet's learning technique relies on gradient-based learning and is prone to becoming stuck in local minima. Age, sex, chest discomfort, blood sugar, Blood pressure (BP), and other factors are acquired from clinical records to estimate the risk of heart disease. Heart state is recognized by classifying acquired sensor data employing Rec-CONVnet. Simulation and assessment are carried out to exhibit that Rec-CONVnet performs marvelously concerning illness prediction. Outcomes of the simulation indicate that Rec-CONVnet prediction paradigm attains finer precision than the rest of the techniques. The proffered Rec-CONVnet attains an F1-score of 97%, FPR of 64.6%, accuracy rate of 96.4%, and precision 76.2%.  © 2022 IEEE.;classification--deep learning--Deep neural network--feature selection--heart illness;Blood pressure--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Convolution--Deep neural networks--Diagnosis--Diseases--Forecasting--Learning algorithms--Medical applications--Recurrent neural networks--Risk perception--Classification process--Deep learning--Fatality rates--Features selection--Heart disease--Heart illness--Medical data sets--Medical services--Neural-networks--Wearable devices--Heart;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85132545189

We present an automated method of information extraction from German unstructured clinical routine data from the cardiology domain enabling their usage in state-of-the-art data-driven deep learning projects. Methods: We evaluated pre-trained language models to extract a set of 12 cardiovascular concepts in German discharge letters. We compared three bidirectional encoder representations from transformers pre-trained on different corpora and fine-tuned them on the task of cardiovascular concept extraction using 204 discharge letters manually annotated by cardiologists at the University Hospital Heidelberg. We compared our results with traditional machine learning methods based on a long short-term memory network and a conditional random field. Results: Our best performing model, based on publicly available German pre-trained bidirectional encoder representations from the transformer model, achieved a token-wise micro-average F1-score of 86% and outperformed the baseline by at least 6%. Moreover, this approach achieved the best trade-off between precision (positive predictive value) and recall (sensitivity). Conclusion: Our results show the applicability of state-of-the-art deep learning methods using pre-trained language models for the task of cardiovascular concept extraction using limited training data. This minimizes annotation efforts, which are currently the bottleneck of any application of data-driven deep learning projects in the clinical domain for German and many other European languages. © The Author(s) 2021.;bidirectional encoder representations from transformer--Deep learning--fine-tuning--medical information extraction--natural language processing--pre-trained language models;;SAGE Publications Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85120324519

So, ECG signals play a crucial role in preventing CVD by promptly detecting atrial fibrillation in a patient. Unfortunately, locating trustworthy automatic AF in clinical settings remains difficult. Today, deep learning is a potent tool for complex data analysis since it requires little pre and postprocessing. As a result, several machine learning and deep learning approaches have recently been applied to ECG data to diagnose AF automatically. This study analyses electrocardiogram (ECG) data from the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology (CinC) Challenge 2017 to differentiate between atrial fibrillation (AF) and three other rhythms: normal, other, and too noisy for assessment. The ECG data, including AF rhythm, was classified using a novel model based on a combination of traditional machine learning techniques and deep neural networks. To categorize AF rhythms from ECG data, this hybrid model combined a convolutional neural network (Residual Network (ResNet)) with a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BLSTM) network and a Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network. Both the F1-score and the accuracy of the final hybrid model are relatively high, coming in at 0.80% and 0.85%, respectively.  © 2022 Saroj Kumar Pandey et al.;;Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Learning algorithms--Radial basis function networks--Atrial fibrillation--Automatic Detection--Cardiac rhythms--Clinical settings--Complex data--Electrocardiogram signal--Hybrid model--Learning techniques--Machine-learning--Rhythm disorders--Electrocardiograms;Hindawi Limited;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85139561063

Human assessments reduce the complex patterns of cardiac wall motion, to a small list of measurements of heart function. All modern echocardiography artificial intelligence (AI) systems are similarly limited by design – automating measurements of the same reductionist metrics rather than utilizing the embedded wealth of data. This underutilization is most evident where clinical decision making is guided by subjective assessments of disease acuity. Predicting the likelihood of developing post-operative right ventricular failure (RV failure) in the setting of mechanical circulatory support is one such example. Here we describe a video AI system trained to predict post-operative RV failure using the full spatiotemporal density of information in pre-operative echocardiography. We achieve an AUC of 0.729, and show that this ML system significantly outperforms a team of human experts at the same task on independent evaluation. © 2021, The Author(s).;;Deep Learning--Echocardiography--Heart--Heart Failure--Humans--Postoperative Period--Preoperative Care--Retrospective Studies--Ventricular Dysfunction, Right--Video Recording--cardiology--cardiovascular disease--decision making--machine learning--videography--Article--artificial intelligence--assisted circulation--automation--clinical assessment--clinical decision making--controlled study--deep learning--echocardiography--evaluation study--heart right ventricle failure--human--postoperative period--predictive value--spatiotemporal analysis--videorecording--diagnostic imaging--heart--heart failure--heart right ventricle function--pathophysiology--postoperative period--preoperative care--retrospective study--surgery--videorecording;Nature Research;34465780;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85114413399

The discontinuous breathing due to upper airway blocking may lead to various cardiovascular and neurological complications such as hypertension and stroke. Polysomnography and manual scanning of ECG signals are time-consuming and expensive techniques. Thus, a need arises for exploring the alternatives to these techniques. The existing literature highlights the efficacy of machine learning and deep learning techniques in the detection of sleep apnea using ECG signals. The comparison of 2-Dimensional and 1-Dimensional convolution neural network-based models stipulate that 2-Dimensional models are better in efficacy, whereas of 1-Dimensional models are more adaptive and compact. Therefore, in this study, the authors looked for a trade-off and designed a novel 1-Dimensional architecture '1-D Channel Attention Convolution Neural Network' for the detection of sleep apnea. This compact architecture achieves better accuracy than other 1-Dimensional models with a limited number of parameters. First, it uses the Savitzky-Golay filter for noise suppression, thereafter it uses the smoothened signals for classification. The model utilizes channel attention layers to refine the intermediate feature descriptors before passing them deeper into the network. Thus, simultaneously reducing the need of implementing a deep neural network. The 1-D Channel Attention Convolution Neural Network reports the highest average accuracy of 93.01%, specificity of 93.10%, and sensitivity of 92.93% for sleep apnea detection. The results obtained prove that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art 1-D convolution neural network architectures. © 2022 IEEE.;Classification--Convolution Neural Networks--Signal Processing--Sleep Apnea--Spatial Attention;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Economic and social effects--Electrocardiography--Heart--Learning systems--Network architecture--Sleep research--2 - Dimensional--Convolution neural network--D-channel--Dimensional model--ECG signals--Obstructive sleep apnea--Signal-processing--Sleep apnea--Sleep apnea detection--Spatial attention--Deep neural networks;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85141586442

Not only aged people, middle-aged and young people are also suffering due to this and lead to death in the early ages. So there is a significant need in detecting cardiovascular diseases in beginning itself. Through early detection and persistent treatment, the death rate in the early ages due to cardiovascular diseases can be reduced. However, it is necessary to have an efficient model to detect heart disease at an early stage even without the presence of a trained clinical expert. This paper studies the implementation of deep learning models to classify heartbeat sounds into various classes. We proposed a stacked LSTM model to classify the heartbeat sound into multiple classes based on the features obtained from the audio signals. The implementation can even predict the class of an unlabelled heartbeat sound. The model classifies the heartbeat sounds into 4 classes with accuracies 85% and 87% on training and validation sets respectively. In further the proposed model parameters can be improved to increase the classification and prediction accuracy. © 2022 IEEE.;Cardiovascular diseases--Deep Learning--Heartbeat Sounds--Machine Learning--Stacked LSTM;Audio acoustics--Diseases--Forecasting--Heart--Learning systems--Long short-term memory--Cardiovascular disease--Condition--Deep learning--Early age--Food habit--Heart sounds--Heartbeat sound--Machine-learning--Multi-class classification--Stacked LSTM--Cardiology;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85136326141

Due to these diseases failure conditions like left-sided failure, right-sided failure, diastolic failure, and systolic failure are most frequently observed. A wide variety of body parameter abnormalities constitute towards these conditions. For instance, factors like patient's age, anaemia dosage, creatinine and phosphokinase levels, presence of diabetes, ejection fraction of heart, presence of high blood pressure, number of platelets, levels of serum creatinine & serum sodium, smoking frequency, etc. are observed to directly affect normal heart functioning. Efficient analysis of these parameters must be done in order to estimate probability of heart failure, which can assist in better clinical care. Currently researched models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), random forests (RFs), support vector machines (SVMs) are limited in terms of accuracy, and precision performance when applied on multiple types of patient datasets. In order to improve this performance, the underlying text proposes design of an augmented ensemble learning model that combines RFs, Decision Tree (DT), Gradient Boosting (GB), Linear Regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), Naïve Bayes (NB), SVM with radial basis kernel, SVM with linear kernel, k Nearest Neighbour (kNN), long-short-term-memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural network (RNN), and LR with selected features. Performance of these classification models is evaluated individually, and then an entity-pattern-level model selection process is performed. This process assists in selection of the best performing model for a given feature pattern, thereby improving overall efficiency of the system. It is observed that the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 99.5% on different datasets, which is superior when compared to various state-of-the-art techniques & various CNN architectures. Due to such a high performance, the proposed model is observed to be applicable for various clinical purposes. © 2022 IEEE.;augmentation--classification--deep learning--ensemble--Heart disease;Blood pressure--Cardiology--Convolutional neural networks--Creatinine--Decision trees--Diseases--Heart--Logistic regression--Long short-term memory--Nearest neighbor search--Augmentation--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Ensemble--Failure prediction models--Heart disease--Heart failure--Performance--Random forests--Support vectors machine--Support vector machines;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85135608921

In past years heart disease or cardiovascular disease cause large impact in medical industries, so they are really very dangerous and have a large impact worldwide. Although precious prediction of heart diseases or CD and also the 24-hour monitoring on patient is not possible because it requires lots of knowledge and time. Heart disease treatment or diagnosis are very complicated, mainly in the poor countries or the countries which not fully developed. Also because of not having proper medical attention or timely cure of disease it can lead to death of the person. The medical industry has a large amount of data and is continuously used by researchers to develop new science and technology to minimize the number of deaths happens due to heart disease. Lots of data mining and ML techniques or algorithms are available to fetch the data from databases and use this fetched data to predict the heart diseases very accurately. In this heart disease model, we used machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms, we have implemented all algorithms on the dataset. The dataset used is from Kaggle which is of 303 rows and 14 attribute. The algorithm that are used in the model are Logistic Regression, NB, K-NN, SVM, Multi-Layer Perceptron's, Artificial Neural Network, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XG Boost and Cat Boost.  © 2022 IEEE.;Cardiovascular Diseases--Heart disease--Heart Disease Prediction--Machine learning;Cardiology--Data mining--Decision trees--Deep learning--Developing countries--Diagnosis--Diseases--Heart--Learning algorithms--Logistic regression--Multilayer neural networks--Nearest neighbor search--Patient treatment--Support vector machines--Cardiovascular disease--Disease cause--Disease diagnosis--Disease treatment--Heart disease--Heart disease prediction--Machine-learning--Medical industries--Prediction of heart disease--Forecasting;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85137154513

Acute Rheumatic Fever (ARF) is a precursor to the disease. Sometimes, RHD can occur without any signs or symptoms, and if there are any symptoms, they occur with the infection in the heart valves and fever. Due to these issues, respiratory problems occur with chest pain and tremors. Additionally, the symptoms include faint, heart murmurs, stroke and unexpected collapse. The techniques available try to detect the RHD as early as possible. Although the recent medical health care department uses crucial techniques, they are not accurate in terms of symptom classification, precision and prediction. On the scope, we are developing Multi-Layered Acoustic Neural (MLAN) Networks to detect the RHD symptoms using heart beat sound and Electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements. In this proposed MLAN system, the novel techniques such as multi-attribute acoustic data sampling model, heart sound sampling procedures, ECG data sampling model, RHD Recurrent Convolutional Network (RRCN) and Acoustic Support Vector Machine (ASVM) are used for increasing the accuracy. In the implementation section, the proposed model has been compared to the Long Short-Term Memory-based Cardio (LSTC) data analysis model, Cardio-Net and Video-Based Deep Learning (VBDL) techniques. In this comparison, the proposed system has 10%-17% higher accuracy in RHD detection than existing techniques.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.;Diagnosis--DL techniques--ECG--heart disease--heart sound analysis--RHD;Cardiology--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Diseases--Heart--Multilayer neural networks--Network layers--Support vector machines--Data sampling--DL technique--Heart disease--Heart sound analysis--Multi-layered--Multi-layers--Network-based--Neural-networks--Rheumatic heart disease--Sampling model--Electrocardiograms;World Scientific;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85139006808

Measuring the drowsiness of the driver and taking timely actions can avoid such accidents. Earlier, conventional methods such as eye states and facial expressions were used to detect drowsiness. Nowadays new techniques have been developed for the same purpose, which uses bio-electric signals like an Electro Cardio Gram(ECG). Heart Rate Variability (HRV) can be used to assess drivers' drowsiness, fatigue, and stress levels. HRV is determined by the interval of RR measured by an Electro Cardiogram. Twelve features are monitored, including both time and frequency domains, in order to determine the HRV changes. HRV monitoring is used to actually predict epileptic seizures. The proposed work uses Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis with a Machine Learning and Deep Learning to detect drowsiness. A comparison is also made between the performance of four different Machine Learning(ML) algorithms while using one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs). Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used increasingly in Computer Vision and Machine Learning operations. 2D CNNs consist of millions of parameters and many hidden layers, and it has Interpreting complex patterns and objects. Two-dimensional signals, such as images and video frames, are used as inputs for 2D CNNs. However, this may not be the ideal choice in many applications, especially those involving One-Dimensional signals such as biomedical signals. To solve the problem, 1D CNNs were introduced with the highest level of performance. Specifically, the 1D CNN has four layers: a Convolutional Layer, Batch Normalization Layer, Maxpooling Layer, and Fully Connected Layer. The proposed strategy has the potential to help avoid accidents caused by drowsy driving. © 2021 IEEE.;Electro Cardio Gram(ECG)--Heart Rate Variability(HRV)--Machine Learning(ML)--One Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network(1D CNNs);Accidents--Bioelectric phenomena--Bioinformatics--Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Electroencephalography--Electrophysiology--Heart--Learning algorithms--Multilayer neural networks--Convolutional neural network--Driver drowsiness--Drowsy driving--Electro cardio gram--Heart rate variability--Machine learning algorithms--Machine-learning--One dimensional convolutional neural network(1d CNN)--One-dimensional--Performance--Electrocardiography;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85119487838

The small heart size and the lack of expertise in fetal echocardiography of some sonography pose challenges in terms of research. The use of technology to enhance the image assists in the diagnosis of abnormalities important for optimal fetal cardiac assessment. Multi object detection is the most challenging but very informative task in basic machine learning. We must detect cardiac substructure precisely the condition of the fetal heart, especially in normal conditions. Knowing the normal heart substructure can provide information about the presence or absence of fetal heart abnormalities. Multiple ways to view fetal heart chambers, four chambers (4CH) basic standard cardiac scan, left and right ventricular outflow tract (LVOT/RVOT) focusing on structural pathways, and Three Tracheal Vessels (3VV/3VT) complex fetal heart scan confirms flow in the three blood vessels helps determine whether aortic arch problems are causing normal heart conditions or not.

However, conventional measurements require inconvenient cuff-based instruments and are not able to detect continuous blood pressure. Advanced methods utilize machine learning to estimate BP by constructing artificial features in plethysmography (PPG) or using an end-to-end deep learning framework to estimate BP directly. Empirical features are limited by current research on cardiovascular disease and are not sufficient to express BP variability, while data-driven approaches neglect expert knowledge and lack interpretability. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a method for continuous BP estimation that extracts both artificial and data-driven features from PPG to take advantage of expert knowledge and deep learning at the same time. Then a deep residual neural network is designed to reduce information redundancy in the gathered features and refine high-level features for BP estimation. The results show that our proposed methods outperforms the compared methods in three commonly used metrics. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;Artificial features--Blood pressure estimation--Data-driven features--Plethysmography;Blood--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Learning systems--Plethysmography--Artificial feature--Blood pressure estimation--Cardiovascular disease--Conventional measurements--Cuffless--Data driven--Data-driven feature--Expert knowledge--Health condition--Machine-learning--Blood pressure;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85137269410

Prediction of heart disease at an earlier stage becomes crucial to prevent the disease or in the treatment of the disease. However, predicting the heart condition accurately as per symptoms is challenging, even for experienced doctors. The most demanding job is to anticipate the illness accurately. The medical or health sector is generating a large amount of data about heart disease every year. The easy availability of data in medical and healthcare fields and the accurate analyzing techniques for the medical data of earlier patients make it possible to predict various diseases. Machine learning algorithms may be used with medical information to forecast cardiac illness successfully. Developing the predictor of heart disease using machine learning algorithms is more beneficial than conventional approaches for accurate predictions of disease. This article proposes a deep learning model better than the other existing machine learning techniques. The dataset utilized for prediction is the heart dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/. The proposed model has been compared with k-nearest neighbors (kNN), logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN).

With the collected data, feature extraction process is performed initially, in which heart rate, zero crossing rate, and higher order statistical features like standard deviation, median, skewness, kurtosis, variance, mean, peak amplitude, and entropy are extracted. For acquiring most significant features, the optimal feature selection process is implemented. As a novel contribution, the feature selection process is done by the hybrid optimization algorithm called PS-GWO by integrating GWO and PSO. Next, the extracted features are subjected to a famous deep learning algorithm named modified DBN, in which the activation function and number of hidden neurons is optimized using the same developed hybrid algorithm to improve the heart diagnosis accuracy. From the analysis, for the test case 1, the accuracy of the developed PS-GWO-DBN is 60%, 52.5%, 35% and 35% increased than NN, KNN, SVM, and DBN. For test case 2, the accuracy of the proposed PS-GWO-DBN is 26%, 24%, 21.6% and 17% increased than NN, KNN, SVM, and DBN, respectively. The accuracy of the designed PS-GWO-DBN is 26% advanced than NN, 24% advanced than KNN, 21.6% advanced than SVM and 17% advanced than DBN for test case 3. Thus, the proposed heart disease prediction model using PS-GWO-DBN performs better than other classifiers. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;deep belief network--Heart disease diagnosis--internet of things--optimal feature selection--particle swarm-based Grey Wolf optimization;Algorithms--Entropy--Heart--Heart Diseases--Humans--Wearable Electronic Devices--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Heart--Higher order statistics--Internet of things--Learning algorithms--Particle swarm optimization (PSO)--Predictive analytics--Wearable technology--creatinine--Activation functions--Deep belief networks--Heart disease diagnosis--Hybrid optimization algorithm--Number of hidden neurons--Optimal feature selections--Statistical features--Wearable medical devices--algorithm--anemia--Article--artificial intelligence--artificial neural network--bioinformatics--cardiovascular disease--classifier--computer aided design--controlled study--deep belief network--deep learning--diagnostic accuracy--diagnostic test accuracy study--disease severity--entropy--feature extraction--glucose blood level--heart disease--heart rate--hypertension--image segmentation--internet of things--learning algorithm--machine learning--nerve cell--nerve cell network--obesity--prediction--quantitative structure activity relation--risk factor--RR interval--skin infection--systematic review--training--electronic device--heart--heart disease--human--Feature extraction;Taylor and Francis Ltd.;34311642;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85111667489

Objective: This study aimed to develop a time-adaptive conditional prediction model (TACOM) to predict clinical outcomes every minute. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study using data from the Korea OHCA Registry in South Korea. In this study, we excluded patients with trauma, those who experienced return of spontaneous circulation before arriving in the emergency department (ED), and those who did not receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the ED. We selected patients who received CPR in the ED. To develop the time-adaptive prediction model, we organized the training data set as ongoing CPR patients by the minute. A total of 49,669 patients were divided into 39,602 subjects for training and 10,067 subjects for validation. We compared random forest, LightGBM, and artificial neural networks as the prediction model methods. Model performance was quantified using the prediction probability of the model, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and area under the precision recall curve. Results: Among the three algorithms, LightGBM showed the best performance. From 0 to 30 min, the AUROC of the TACOM for predicting good neurological outcomes ranged from 0.910 (95% CI 0.910-0.911) to 0.869 (95% CI 0.865-0.871), whereas that for survival to hospital discharge ranged from 0.800 (95% CI 0.797-0.800) to 0.734 (95% CI 0.736-0.740). The prediction probability of the TACOM showed similar flow with cohort data based on a comparison with the conventional model's prediction probability. Conclusions: The TACOM predicted the clinical outcome of OHCA patients per minute. This model for predicting patient outcomes by the minute can assist clinicians in making rational decisions for OHCA patients. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Predicting heart disease is challenging because it requires substantial experience and knowledge. Several research studies have found that the diagnostic accuracy of heart disease is low. The coronary heart disorder determines the state that influences the heart valves, causing heart disease. Two indications of coronary heart disorder are strep throat with a red persistent skin rash, and a sore throat covered by tonsils or strep throat. This work focuses on a hybrid machine learning algorithm that helps predict heart attacks and arterial stiffness. At first, we achieved the component perception measured by using a hybrid cuckoo search particle swarm optimization (CSPSO) algorithm. With this perception measure, characterization and accuracy were improved, while the execution time of the proposed model was decreased. The CSPSO-deep recurrent neural network algorithm resolved issues that state-of-the-art methods face. Our proposed method offers an illustrative framework that helps predict heart attacks with high accuracy. The proposed technique demonstrates the model accuracy, which reached 0.97 with the applied dataset. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

The integration of AI is expected to cause a revolution in various areas of medicine, including gastrointestinal (GI) pathology. Currently, deep learning algorithms have shown promising benefits in areas of diagnostic histopathology, such as tumor identification, classification, prognosis prediction, and biomarker/genetic alteration prediction. While AI cannot substitute pathologists, carefully constructed AI applications may increase workforce productivity and diagnostic accuracy in pathology practice. Regardless of these promising advances, unlike the areas of radiology or cardiology imaging, no histopathology-based AI application has been approved by a regulatory authority or for public reimbursement. Thus, implying that there are still some obstacles to be overcome before AI applications can be safely and effectively implemented in real-life pathology practice. The challenges have been identified at different stages of the development process, such as needs identification, data curation, model development, validation, regulation, modification of daily workflow, and cost-effectiveness balance. The aim of this review is to present challenges in the process of AI development, validation, and regulation that should be overcome for its implementation in real-life GI pathology practice. © The Author(s) 2021.

This study aims to develop robust segmentation techniques for segmenting the left ventricle (LV) in ultrasound images to check myocardium movement during heartbeat. The proposed technique utilizes machine learning (ML) techniques such as the active contour (AC) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for segmentation. Medical experts determine the consistency between the proposed ML approach, which is a state-of-the-art deep learning method, and the manual segmentation approach. These methods are compared in terms of performance indicators such as the ventricular area (VA), ventricular maximum diameter (VMXD), ventricular minimum diameter (VMID), and ventricular long axis angle (AVLA) measurements. Furthermore, the Dice similarity coefficient, Jaccard index, and Hausdorff distance are measured to estimate the agreement of the LV segmented results between the automatic and visual approaches. The obtained results indicate that the proposed techniques for LV segmentation are useful and practical. There is no significant difference between the use of AC and CNN in image segmentation--however, the AC method could obtain comparable accuracy as the CNN method using less training data and less run-time. © 2020;Active contour--Cardiac ultrasonography--Convolutional neural network--Intra-operative ultrasound--left ventricle;Echocardiography--Heart Ventricles--Image Processing, Computer-Assisted--Imaging, Three-Dimensional--Machine Learning--Neural Networks, Computer--Cardiology--Convolution--Deep learning--Image segmentation--Learning systems--Ultrasonic applications--Comparative analysis--Echocardiographic imaging--Hausdorff distance--Manual segmentation--Myocardial Infarction--Performance indicators--Robust segmentation--Similarity coefficients--adult--Article--cardiac muscle--comparative study--controlled study--convolutional neural network--deep learning--diagnostic test accuracy study--echocardiography--heart cycle--heart infarction--heart left ventricle mass--heart left ventricle outflow tract--heart ventricle septum defect--human--image segmentation--major clinical study--medical expert--mitral valve--support vector machine--diagnostic imaging--echocardiography--heart ventricle--image processing--machine learning--three-dimensional imaging--Convolutional neural networks;Elsevier Ireland Ltd;33383330;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85098683141

This paper tries to assess the capabilities of AI in the field of cardiology during the COVID-19 pandemic. This technology is useful to provide advanced technology-based treatment in cardiology as it can help analyse and measure the functioning of the human heart. Methods: We have studied a good number of research papers on Artificial Intelligence on cardiology during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify its significant benefits, applications, and future scope. AI uses artificial neuronal networks (ANN) to predict. In cardiology, it is used to predict the survival of a COVID-19 patient from heart failure. Results: AI involves complex algorithms for predicting somewhat successful diagnosis and treatments. This technology uses different techniques, such as cognitive computing, deep learning, and machine learning. It is incorporated to make a decision and resolve complex challenges. It can focus on a large number of diseases, their causes, interactions, and prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper introduces AI-based care and studies its need in the field of cardiology. Finally, eleven major applications of AI in cardiology during the COVID-19 pandemic are identified and discussed. Conclusions: Cardiovascular diseases are one of the major causes of death in human beings, and it is increasing for the last few years. Cardiology patients' treatment is expensive, so this technology is introduced to provide a new pathway and visualise cardiac anomalies. AI is used to identify novel drug therapies and improve the efficiency of a physician. It is precise to predict the outcome of the COVID-19 patient from cardiac-based algorithms.

Deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) methods have become increasingly common in studying the various factors involved in cardiovascular disease. The usage of retinal scanning techniques to diagnose retinal diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and others, using fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) has been extensively documented. Researchers are now looking to combine the power of AI with the non-invasive ease of retinal scanning to examine the workings of the heart and predict changes in the macrovasculature based on microvascular features and function. In this review, we summarize the current state of the field in using retinal imaging to diagnose cardiovascular issues and other diseases.

The purpose of the present review was to summarize the literature on the developing field of deep learning (DL), particularly the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in PET/CT and PET/MR. Methods: We performed the literature search, referring to “convolutional neural networks” and “positron emission tomography” on PubMed/MEDLINE, for potentially relevant articles published up until July 24th, 2020. Results: After the screening process, 63 articles were finally included--these embraced both the technical (n = 23) and the clinical field (n = 40). Technical studies aimed at investigating the role of CNN-based methods for image quality improvement (n = 11) and on technical issues (n = 12), mainly attenuation correction. Clinical studies explored CNN applications in oncology lung cancer (n = 7), head and neck cancer (n = 4), esophageal cancer (n = 2), lymphoma (n = 3), prostate cancer (N = 4), cervical cancer (n = 1), sarcomas (n = 1), multiple cancer types (n = 4), in neurology (n = 10) and cardiology (n = 1)--three additional studies belonged to “other” category. In oncology, the studies aimed at detection, diagnosis, and prognostication of cancer. In neurology, the majority of the studies aimed at diagnosing Alzheimer Disease and stratification of the risk. CNN-based algorithms demonstrated promising results with performances equal or even higher compared to conventional approaches. Discussion: Overall, CNN applications for PET/CT and PET/MR are exponentially growing, demonstrating encouraging results for both technical and clinical purposes. Novel research strategies emerged to face the challenges of DL algorithms development. Education and confidence with DL-based tools are needed for proper technology implementation. © 2021, Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.;Artificial intelligence--Convolutional neural networks--Machine learning--PET/CT--PET/MR;fluorodeoxyglucose f 18--Alzheimer disease--artificial intelligence--artificial neural network--cardiology--convolutional neural network--decision tree--deep learning--diagnostic test accuracy study--esophagus cancer--head and neck cancer--human--image analysis--image quality--learning algorithm--lung cancer--lymphoma--machine learning--multiple cancer--neurology--nuclear magnetic resonance imaging--nuclear medicine--positron emission tomography-computed tomography--predictive value--prostate cancer--radiation exposure--Review--sarcoma--sensitivity and specificity--support vector machine--systematic review--uterine cervix cancer;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85099934642

Most real datasets include an irregular subset with higher variance than most data, and predictive models do not learn well from these datasets. While most existing prediction models learned from the whole or randomly sampled training datasets, our suggested method draws up training datasets by separating regular and highly biased subsets to build accurate prediction models. We use a two-step approach to prepare the training dataset: (1) divide the initial training dataset into two groups, commonly distributed and highly biased using Principal Component Analysis, (2) enrich the highly biased group by Variational Autoencoders. Then, two deep neural network classifiers learn from the isolated training groups separately. The well-organized training groups enable a chance to build more accurate prediction models. When predicting the risk of coronary heart disease from the given input, only one appropriate model is selected based on the reconstruction error on the Principal Component Analysis model. Dataset used in this study was collected from the Korean National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey. We have conducted two types of experiments on the dataset. The first one proved how Principal Component Analysis and Variational Autoencoder models of the proposed method improves the performance of a single deep neural network. The second experiment compared the proposed method with existing machine learning algorithms, including Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Adaptive Boosting. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperformed conventional machine learning algorithms by giving the accuracy of 0.892, specificity of 0.840, precision of 0.911, recall of 0.920, f-measure of 0.915, and AUC of 0.882. © 2013 IEEE.;Coronary heart disease--deep neural network--machine learning--principal component analysis--reconstruction error--variational autoencoder;Adaptive boosting--Cardiology--Decision trees--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Forecasting--Heart--Nearest neighbor search--Risk assessment--Support vector machines--Auto encoders--Coronary heart disease--Disease risks--Efficient predictions--Prediction methods--Prediction modelling--Principal-component analysis--Reconstruction error--Training dataset--Variational autoencoder--Principal component analysis;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85117027445

The morbidity and lethality caused by cardiovascular disease are constantly increasing every year. In this paper, we propose a two-stream style operation to handle the electrocardiogram (ECG) classification: one for time-domain features and another for frequency-domain features. For the time-domain features, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are constructed for feature learning and classification of ECG signals. For the frequency-domain features, support vector regression (SVR) machines are designed to perform the regression prediction on each signal. Finally, the D-S evidence theory is adopted to perform the decision fusion strategy on the time-domain and frequency-domain classification results. We confirm a recognition performance of 99.64% from the experiment result for the D-S evidence theory recognition system upon the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The analysis of various methods of ECG classification shows that the model delivers superior performance promotion across all these scenarios. © 2021 Jixiang Zhang et al.;;Algorithms--Arrhythmias, Cardiac--Electrocardiography--Humans--Neural Networks, Computer--Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted--Support Vector Machine--Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Convolutional neural networks--Decision theory--Electrocardiography--Frequency domain analysis--Time domain analysis--Cardiovascular disease--Convolutional neural network--D S evidence theory--Domain feature--Electrocardiogram signal classifications--Frequency domains--Neural network features--Performance--Time domain features--Wavelet features--Article--artificial neural network--atrial fibrillation--cardiologist--complete heart block--controlled study--convolutional neural network--cross validation--decision making--deep belief network--ectopic atrial tachycardia--electrocardiogram--feature extraction--heart arrhythmia--heart atrium flutter--heart left bundle branch block--heart right bundle branch block--heart ventricle extrasystole--heart ventricle fibrillation--heart ventricle tachycardia--human--image segmentation--low frequency noise--major clinical study--multilayer perceptron--prediction--QRS complex--R wave--radial basis function--restricted Boltzmann machine--signal processing--support vector machine--supraventricular premature beat--wavelet analysis--wavelet transform--algorithm--electrocardiography--heart arrhythmia--signal processing--Diseases;Hindawi Limited;34531965;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85115793812

Among the heart diseases can be indicate by ECG monitoring, much effort have been endeavored towards automatic heart arrhythmia diagnosis based on machine learning methods. However, traditional machine learning models require time-consuming preprocessing and laborious feature extraction which highly depend on domain knowledge. Here, we propose a novel deep learning model, named Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Networks (ABCNN) that taking advantage of CNN and multi-head attention, to work straight on raw ECG data and extract the informative dependencies automatically for accurate arrhythmia detection. The proposed method is evaluated by extensive experiments over a public benchmark ECG dataset. Our main task is to find the arrhythmia from normal heartbeats and, at the meantime, accurately recognize the heart diseases from five arrhythmia types. We also provide convergence analysis of ABCNN and intuitively show the meaningfulness of extracted representation through visualization. The experimental results show that the proposed ABCNN outperforms the widely used baselines, which puts one step closer to intelligent heart disease diagnosis system. © 2021 IEEE.;attention mechanism--CNN--data mining--deep neural networks--ECG--healthcare--heart arrhythmia;Cardiology--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Data mining--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Domain Knowledge--Heart--Attention mechanisms--CNN--Condition--Convolutional neural network--Electrical activities--Heart arrhythmia diagnosis--Heart arrhythmias--Heart disease--Heart function--Measurements of--Electrocardiography;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85123767167

In developing countries like Pakistan, advanced medical facilities are not easily accessible for everyone to treat such anomalies, that's why early prediction and precautions are necessary. Our proposed model facilitates this early prediction based on various factors extracted from medical research like gender, parents age, miscarriage history, supplements intake, medicines used during pregnancy, family CHD history, parents' lifestyle, and nutrition. Based on these factors, a questionnaire has been designed to collect data from different hospitals. We collected samples of 518 mothers from hospitals in Lahore, Pakistan. After applying different cleaning and scaling techniques for data pre-processing, different machine learning models are applied to the data, which includes KNN classifier, decision tree, random forest, support vector classifier, and a deep learning model MLP (multilayer perceptron). Among all MLP classifiers performed best with an accuracy of 92.9% on our data using a cross-validation technique. Our result will facilitate the early prediction of CHD that will help ease the burden of congenital heart defects. © 2021 IEEE.;Birth defects--CHD prediction--Deep neural network--Healthcare automation--Heart defect--Machine learning--Multilayer perceptron--Pre-birth prediction;Cardiology--Data handling--Decision trees--Deep neural networks--Developing countries--Heart--Hospitals--Multilayer neural networks--Multilayers--Birth defects--Congenital heart defect prediction--Congenital heart defects--Defect prediction--Early prediction--Healthcare automation--Heart defects--Multilayers perceptrons--Pakistan--Pre-birth prediction--Forecasting;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85124291236

ECG is the gold standard that is widely used for the diagnosis and prognosis of various heart conditions. However, manual inspection of ECG signals is a difficult task and can be s ubjective, time-consuming and susceptible to inter-observer variability. The extraction and segmentation of features in the ECG plays a significant r ole in the diagnosis of most heart disease. Classification s ystems are becoming increasingly popular--their main task is automatically analyze different heart diseases using machine learning and deep learning methods to improve diagnostic accuracy. The main objective of this work is to give an overview of the various machine learning approaches used to analyze the ECG useful for the implementation of Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) allowing to support the diagnosis of the main heart diseases such as myocardial infarction (heart attack), differentiate arrhythmias (heart rate changes), hypertrophy (increased thickness of the heart muscle) and enlargement of the heart.

Timely diagnosis and treatment of CAD is crucial to reduce the incidence of CAD complications like myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemia-induced congestive heart failure (CHF). Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are most commonly employed as the diagnostic screening tool to detect CAD. In this study, an automated system (AS) was developed for the automated categorization of electrocardiogram signals into normal, CAD, myocardial infarction (MI) and congestive heart failure (CHF) classes using convolutional neural network (CNN) and unique GaborCNN models. Weight balancing was used to balance the imbalanced dataset. High classification accuracies of more than 98.5% were obtained by the CNN and GaborCNN models respectively, for the 4-class classification of normal, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure classes. GaborCNN is a more preferred model due to its good performance and reduced computational complexity as compared to the CNN model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to propose GaborCNN model for automated categorizing of normal, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure classes using ECG signals. Our proposed system is equipped to be validated with bigger database and has the potential to aid the clinicians to screen for CVDs using ECG signals. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd;Cardiovascular disease--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Gabor convolutional neural network--Gabor filter--Multi-class classification--Ten-fold validation;Coronary Artery Disease--Electrocardiography--Heart Failure--Humans--Myocardial Infarction--Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted--Automation--Biomedical signal processing--Classification (of information)--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Gabor filters--Heart--Cardiovascular disease--Congestive heart failures--Convolutional neural network--Coronary artery disease--Deep learning--Electrocardiogram signal--Gabor convolutional neural network--Multi-class classification--Myocardial Infarction--Ten-fold validation--Article--artificial neural network--automation--back propagation--classification--congestive heart failure--controlled study--convolutional neural network--coronary artery disease--deep learning--diagnostic accuracy--electrocardiography--Gabor convolutional neural network--heart infarction--human--machine learning--major clinical study--multiclass classification--priority journal--random forest--sensitivity and specificity--coronary artery disease--electrocardiography--heart failure--heart infarction--signal processing--Cardiology;Elsevier Ltd;33991857;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85105592488

Early detection of AF can result in a lower risk of stroke, heart failure, systemic thromboembolism, and coronary artery disease. AF detection however is challenging due to the need for specialised equipment and professional technicians. Hand-held electrocardiogram (ECG) devices, including wearables, are now available and provide a potential mechanism for detecting AF. We wished to identify AF from short single-lead ECG recordings using a machine learning method. Methods: We predicted AF from ECG signals by stacking a support vector machine (SVM) on statistical features of segment-based recognition units produced by a convolutional neural network. We used the ECG dataset from the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017, which contained 8528 ECG recordings, to validate our method. Results: ECG recordings were categorised into four classes with an average F1 score of 84.19% under fivefold cross-validations. Conclusions: Our model performed better than other state-of-the-art methods applied to the same dataset using the same metric. This stacking method can be generalised for other problems related to medical signals as it does not require expertise in analysing ECG data. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd;Atrial fibrillation--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--ECG--Recognition;Convolution--Deep neural networks--Electrocardiography--Support vector machines--Atrial fibrillation--Cardiac rhythms--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Electrocardiogram recordings--Recognition--Rhythm disorders--Segment-based--Stackings--Support vectors machine--Article--atrial fibrillation--convolutional neural network--cross validation--deep learning--electrocardiogram--machine learning--parameters--priority journal--signal processing--support vector machine--Diseases;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85105254184

Apart from direct determination of LDL values, models (or equations) are used. A more recent approach is the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms. Methods: ML algorithms were used for LDL determination (regression) from cholesterol, HDL and triglycerides. The methods used were multivariate Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN), in both larger and smaller data sets. Also, LDL values were classified according to both NCEP III and European Society of Cardiology guidelines. Results: The performance of regression was assessed by the Standard Error of the Estimate. ML methods performed better than established equations (Friedewald and Martin). The performance all ML methods was comparable for large data sets and was affected by the divergence of the train and test data sets, as measured by the Jensen-Shannon divergence. Classification accuracy was not satisfactory for any model. Conclusions: Direct determination of LDL is the most preferred route. When not available, ML methods can be a good substitute. Not only deep neural networks but other, less computationally expensive methods can work as well as deep learning. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.;Cholesterol--Friedewald--LDL--Machine learning--Triglycerides;Atherosclerosis--Cholesterol, HDL--Cholesterol, LDL--Humans--Machine Learning--Neural Networks, Computer--Triglycerides--cholesterol--high density lipoprotein cholesterol--low density lipoprotein cholesterol--triacylglycerol--low density lipoprotein cholesterol--accuracy--algorithm--Article--cardiovascular risk--classification--deep neural network--linear regression analysis--machine learning--practice guideline--prediction--priority journal--support vector machine--atherosclerosis--human--machine learning;Elsevier B.V.;33667481;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85102608641

The proposed framework based on an innovative stacked dense neural layer and convolution neural network cascade architecture, addresses the significant imbalance in class distribution in CVD event detection task. The experimental evaluation of the proposed model was done on the NHANES super-dataset, obtained by fusion of different subsets of publicly NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) data for prediction of cardiovascular disease. Many machines and deep learning models have been proposed in the literature for CVD event detection. However, they assume balanced class distribution between positive and negative disease classes. For clinical settings, there is significant class imbalance, with few positive class samples as compared to abundant samples from normal or control class. Hence most of the traditional machine and deep learning models are vulnerable to class imbalance, even after using class-specific adjustment of weights (well established method for handling class imbalance) and can lead to poor performance for the minority class detection. The proposed model based on stacked-Dense-CNN cascade architecture is robust and resilient to the class imbalance and has better overall detection accuracy. The first stage of the stacked-Dense-CNN cascade consists of an optimal feature learning stage, comprising a LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection) and majority voting step, for extraction of significant and homogenized features. The second stage use of a novel stacked-Dense-CNN cascade model and a novel model development protocol involving an unique train-test dataset partitioning strategy. Also, by using a specific training routine per epoch, similar to the simulated annealing approach, it was possible to achieve enhanced detection performance, particularly for detection of minority class, and robustness to class imbalance. The experimental evaluation of the novel stacked-Dense-CNN cascade model on a super dataset obtained by fusing multiple data subsets of publicly available NHANES data, resulted in an accuracy of 81.8% accuracy for negative CVD cases (majority class), and 85% for the positive CVD cases (minority class), an improved performance as compared to previously proposed research approaches for imbalanced clinical data settings.  © IEEE 2022.;AI--CVD--Deep Learning--Imbalance--NHANES;Cardiology--Chemical detection--Clinical research--Convolutional neural networks--Decision support systems--Deep learning--Forecasting--Multilayer neural networks--Network architecture--Simulated annealing--Statistical tests--Cardiovascular disease--Cascade architecture--Class distributions--Class imbalance--Decision support framework--Deep learning--Events detection--Experimental evaluation--Imbalance--National health and nutrition examination survey--Diseases;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85127878812

Echocardiography is a ubiquitous modality for evaluating heart structure and function in cardiology. In this work, we use BO to optimize the architectural and training-related hyperparameters of a previously published deep fully convolutional neural network model for multi-structure segmentation in echocardiography. In a fair comparison, the resulting model outperforms this recent state-of-the-art on the annotated CAMUS dataset in both apical two-and four-chamber echo views. We report mean Dice overlaps of 0.95, 0.96, and 0.93 on left ventricular (LV) endocardium, LV epicardium, and left atrium respectively. We also observe significant improvement in derived clinical indices, including smaller median absolute errors for LV end-diastolic volume (4.9mL vs. 6.7), end-systolic volume (3.1mL vs. 5.2), and ejection fraction (2.6% vs. 3.7)--and much tighter limits of agreement, which were already within inter-rater variability for non-contrast echo. These results demonstrate the benefits of BO for echocardiography segmentation over a recent state-of-the-art framework, although validation using large-scale independent clinical data is required.  © 2021 IEEE.;Bayesian Optimization--Echocardiography--Segmentation;Convolutional neural networks--Deep neural networks--Heart--Medical imaging--2D-echocardiography--Bayesian optimization--Clinical indices--Ejection fraction--End-systolic volumes--Heart structures--Left ventricular--Machine learning problem--Echocardiography;IEEE Computer Society;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85107212658

Current machine learning techniques either depend on manually extracted features or large and complex deep learning networks which merely utilize the 1D ECG signal directly. Since intelligent multimodal fusion can perform at the state-of-the-art level with an efficient deep network, therefore, in this paper, we propose two computationally efficient multimodal fusion frameworks for ECG heart beat classification called Multimodal Image Fusion (MIF) and Multimodal Feature Fusion (MFF). At the input of these frameworks, we convert the raw ECG data into three different images using Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Recurrence Plot (RP) and Markov Transition Field (MTF). In MIF, we first perform image fusion by combining three imaging modalities to create a single image modality which serves as input to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In MFF, we extracted features from penultimate layer of CNNs and fused them to get unique and interdependent information necessary for better performance of classifier. These informational features are finally used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for ECG heart-beat classification. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed fusion models by performing experiments on PhysioNet's MIT-BIH dataset for five distinct conditions of arrhythmias which are consistent with the AAMI EC57 protocols and on PTB diagnostics dataset for Myocardial Infarction (MI) classification. We achieved classification accuracy of 99.7% and 99.2% on arrhythmia and MI classification, respectively.

Atherosclerosis disease in the arteries is the main cause of the CVD, leading to myocardial infarction and stroke. The two primary image-based phenotypes used for monitoring the atherosclerosis burden is carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and plaque area (PA). Earlier segmentation and measurement methods were based on ad hoc conventional and semi-automated digital imaging solutions, which are unreliable, tedious, slow, and not robust. This study reviews the modern and automated methods such as artificial intelligence (AI)-based. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) can provide automated techniques in the detection and measurement of cIMT and PA from carotid vascular images. Both ML and DL techniques are examples of supervised learning, i.e., learn from “ground truth” images and transformation of test images that are not part of the training. This review summarizes (1) the evolution and impact of the fast-changing AI technology on cIMT/PA measurement, (2) the mathematical representations of ML/DL methods, and (3) segmentation approaches for cIMT/PA regions in carotid scans based for (a) region-of-interest detection and (b) lumen-intima and media-adventitia interface detection using ML/DL frameworks. AI-based methods for cIMT/PA segmentation have emerged for CVD/stroke risk monitoring and may expand to the recommended parameters for atherosclerosis assessment by carotid ultrasound. © 2021, Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.;Artificial intelligence--Atherosclerosis--Carotid intima-media thickness--Carotid plaque area--Carotid ultrasound--Deep learning--Machine learning--Plaque;Artificial Intelligence--Carotid Arteries--Carotid Intima-Media Thickness--Humans--Stroke--Ultrasonography--Automation--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Image segmentation--Pathology--Ultrasonic applications--Automated techniques--Cardio-vascular disease--Carotid intima-media thickness--Carotid ultrasounds--Interface detection--Mathematical representations--Measurement methods--Myocardial Infarction--arterial wall thickness--artificial intelligence--carotid artery--cerebrovascular accident--diagnostic imaging--echography--human--Risk assessment;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;34080104;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85107435705

Milliken Department of Internal Medicine, Cardiovascular Division, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, United States;The clinical presentation of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) heart failure (HF) patients who will respond to medical therapy (responders) and those who will not (non-responders) is often similar. A machine learning (ML)-based clinical tool to identify responders would prevent unnecessary surgery, while targeting non-responders for early intervention. We used regional left ventricular (LV) contractile injury patterns in ML models to identify IDCM HF non-responders. MRI-based multiparametric strain analysis was performed in 178 test subjects (140 normal subjects and 38 IDCM patients), calculating longitudinal, circumferential, and radial strain over 18 LV sub-regions for inclusion in ML analyses. Patients were identified as responders based upon symptomatic and contractile improvement on medical therapy. We tested the predictive accuracy of support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and deep neural networks (DNN). The DNN model outperformed other models, predicting response to medical therapy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.94. The top features were longitudinal strain in (1) basal: anterior, posterolateral and (2) mid: posterior, anterolateral, and anteroseptal sub-regions. Regional contractile injury patterns predict response to medical therapy in IDCM HF patients, and have potential application in ML-based HF patient care. © 2020, Biomedical Engineering Society.;Deep learning--Heart failure--Machine learning--Magnetic resonance imaging--Myocardial strain--Regional contractile injury;Adult--Cardiomyopathy, Dilated--Female--Heart Failure--Heart Ventricles--Humans--Machine Learning--Magnetic Resonance Imaging--Male--Middle Aged--Ventricular Function, Left--Cardiology--Decision trees--Deep learning--Deep neural networks--Forecasting--Learning systems--Logistic regression--Predictive analytics--Strain--Support vector machines--Support vector regression--Turing machines--Clinical presentations--Dilated cardiomyopathy--Early intervention--Left ventricular--Longitudinal strain--Medical therapy--Predictive accuracy--Receiver operating characteristic curves--adult--Article--brain region--cardiovascular magnetic resonance--cardiovascular parameters--clinical article--clinical feature--clinical outcome--congestive cardiomyopathy--controlled study--female--heart failure--heart injury--heart muscle contractility--heart muscle injury--human--logistic regression analysis--machine learning--male--patient care--prediction--priority journal--random forest--receiver operating characteristic--regional left ventricular contractile injury--regional left ventricular multiparametric strain--support vector machine--treatment response--congestive cardiomyopathy--diagnostic imaging--heart left ventricle function--heart ventricle--middle aged--nuclear magnetic resonance imaging--pathophysiology--Patient treatment;Springer;33006006;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85091786199

Methods We used PCG recordings from two datasets--a publicly available dataset (the 2016 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge), and a dataset that we collected as part of a clinical study we are conducting at Oregon Health Science University (OHSU). We developed a logistic regression classifier to score PCG signal quality using semi-supervised learning and a two-layer perceptron artificial neural network classifier with con textual time-and frequency-domain input features to detect fundamental S1 and S2 heart sounds. We also analyzed the impact of input features on the accuracy of S1 and S2 segmentation. Results: Our segmentation method detects fundamental S1 and S2 heart sounds with a precision of 93% and distinguishes S1/S2 heart sounds with area under the curve (AUC) of 97.1%. Conclusions: Implementing a signal quality assessment tool allows for better segmentation performance as only suitable signals are processed by the S1/S2 sound detection and classification algorithms. Distance between sounds in time-domain are able to distinguish between S1 and S2 with accuracy of 87.4%--however, by adding the frequency-domain features, the accuracy significantly improved to 9 2.4%. Significance: S1 an d S2 heart sound segmentation is the first step in the processes of detecting and classifying heart abnormalities from a PCG. Our proposed method is simple and effective for segmentation for this task. Consequently, it can facilitate the performance of subsequent tasks including the detection of heart murmurs.  © 2021 IEEE.;artificial neural networks (ANN)--heart sound segmentation--machine learning--multi-layer perceptron (MLP)--phonocardiogram (PCG);Convolutional neural networks--Deep neural networks--Frequency domain analysis--Heart--Logistic regression--Multilayer neural networks--Phonocardiography--Time domain analysis--Artificial neural network--Heart sound segmentation--Heart sounds--Input features--Multi-layer perceptron--Multilayers perceptrons--Phonocardiogram--Phonocardiograms--Sound quality assessment--Sound segmentation--Cardiology;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85125166409

In recent years, the number of patients around the world has been increasing significantly, among which people under the age of 45 have become the high-risk group for sudden death of AMI. AMI occurs quickly and does not show obvious symptoms before onset. In addition, postonset clinical testing is also a complex and invasive test, which may cause some postoperative complications. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a noninvasive and convenient auxiliary diagnostic method. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), it is an effective auxiliary diagnostic strategy to complete the disease diagnosis through some body surface features. It is helpful to observe whether the palmar thenar undergoes hypertrophy and whether the metacarpophalangeal joint is swelling in detecting acute myocardial infarction. Combined with deep learning, we propose a depth model based on traditional palm image (MTIALM), which can help doctors of traditional Chinese medicine to predict myocardial infarction. By building the shared network, the model learns information that covers all the tasks. In addition, task-specific attention branch networks are built to simultaneously detect the symptoms of different parts of the palm. The information interaction module (IIM) is proposed to further integrate the information between task branches to ensure that the model learns as many features as possible. Experimental results show that the accuracy of our model in the detection of metacarpophalangeal joints and palmar thenar is 83.16% and 84.15%, respectively, which are significantly improved compared with the traditional classification methods. © 2021 Qida Wang et al.;;Attention--Computational Biology--Databases, Factual--Deep Learning--Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted--Hand--Humans--Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted--Medicine, Chinese Traditional--Myocardial Infarction--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Acute myocardial infarction--Cardio-vascular disease--Classification methods--Information interaction--Metacarpophalangeal joints--Myocardial Infarction--Postoperative complications--Traditional Chinese Medicine--alexnet network--Article--Chinese medicine--deep learning--deep neural network--densenet121 network--diagnostic accuracy--dimensionality reduction--female--hand--hand disease--heart infarction--human--hypertrophy--inceptionv3 network--joint swelling--machine learning--major clinical study--male--mathematical model--metacarpophalangeal joint--mobilenet network--multitask interactive attention learning model--palmar thenar hypertrophy--prediction--resnet 50 network--sensitivity and specificity--task specific attention branch network--vgg16 network--attention--biology--Chinese medicine--computer assisted diagnosis--diagnostic imaging--factual database--hand--heart infarction--pathology--procedures--Learning systems;Hindawi Limited;34737789;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85118996537

Constant patient monitoring enables better medical treatment as it allows practitioners to react on time and provide the appropriate treatment. Telemedicine can provide constant remote monitoring so patients can stay in their homes, only requiring medical sensing equipment and network connections. A limiting factor for telemedical centers is the amount of patients that can be monitored simultaneously. We aim to increase this amount by implementing a decision support system. This paper investigates a machine learning model to estimate a risk score based on patient vital parameters that allows sorting all cases every day to help practitioners focus their limited capacities on the most severe cases. The model we propose reaches an AUCROC of 0.84, whereas the baseline rule-based model reaches an AUCROC of 0.73. Our results indicate that the usage of deep learning to improve the efficiency of telemedical centers is feasible. This way more patients could benefit from better health-care through remote monitoring. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Decision Support System--Heart Failure--Machine Learning--Remote Patient Monitoring--Telemedicine;Cardiology--Decision support systems--Deep learning--Diseases--Patient treatment--Remote control--Risk perception--Telemedicine--Turing machines--Cardio-vascular disease--Machine learning models--Medical intervention--Network connection--Non-communicable disease--Remote monitoring--Rule-based models--Telemedical center--Remote patient monitoring;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85111351269

Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Most of these symptoms are dependent on the type of heart disease and their risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. It is important to control the conditions before they become severe, it can save countless lives. Especially in remote areas and underdeveloped countries where there's no access to necessary medical systems and medical experts at the right time. Therefore, it is important to develop a 'medical system' that can provide heart disease assessments classifications from the clinical data, so that a clinician at a faraway location can reach a decision quickly, allowing them to manage a large number of patients. To do so, collecting clinical data related to heart disease is crucial. An open source dataset that consists of 1,190 samples and multi-variate features is collected from UCI machine learning repository. A total of 14 features are selected for this research. Data normalization is performed on these features to take care of irrelevant values, so that better results can be achieved by the trained models. This research uses three deep learning algorithms, namely Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN), Convolutional Neural network (CNN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to train, validate, and test them with the selected, normalized, and separated data features. Various evaluation metrics were generated to understand the performance of the classification. This research has achieved classification scores of 98.24 % and 98.49% for RBFN and ANN, respectively. Overall, the CNN model has achieved higher accuracy than the other models, with 98.75 %. © 2021 IEEE.;Classification--CNN--Deep Learning--Heart Disease--UCI Machine Learning Repository;Blood pressure--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Diseases--Heart--Information management--Radial basis function networks--Clinical data--Condition--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Efficient predictions--Heart disease--Medical systems--Performance based--Prediction of heart disease--UCI machine learning repository--Learning algorithms;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85125301192

The ECG signals measured from different leads are asynchronous. Artificial intelligence (AI) models for asynchronous ECG signals have barely been explored. Objective: We aimed to develop an AI model for detecting acute myocardial infarction using asynchronous ECGs and compare its performance with that of the automatic ECG interpretations provided by a commercial ECG analysis software. We sought to evaluate the feasibility of implementing multiple lead-based AI-enabled ECG algorithms on smartwatches. Moreover, we aimed to determine the optimal number of leads for sufficient diagnostic power. Methods: We extracted ECGs recorded within 24 hours from each visit to the emergency room of Ajou University Medical Center between June 1994 and January 2018 from patients aged 20 years or older. The ECGs were labeled on the basis of whether a diagnostic code corresponding to acute myocardial infarction was entered. We derived asynchronous ECG lead sets from standard 12-lead ECG reports and simulated a situation similar to the sequential recording of ECG leads via smartwatches. We constructed an AI model based on residual networks and self-attention mechanisms by randomly masking each lead channel during the training phase and then testing the model using various targeting lead sets with the remaining lead channels masked. Results: The performance of lead sets with 3 or more leads compared favorably with that of the automatic ECG interpretations provided by a commercial ECG analysis software, with 8.1%-13.9% gain in sensitivity when the specificity was matched. Our results indicate that multiple lead-based AI-enabled ECG algorithms can be implemented on smartwatches. Model performance generally increased as the number of leads increased (12-lead sets: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 0.880--4-lead sets: AUROC 0.858, SD 0.008--3-lead sets: AUROC 0.845, SD 0.011--2-lead sets: AUROC 0.813, SD 0.018--single-lead sets: AUROC 0.768, SD 0.001). Considering the short amount of time needed to measure additional leads, measuring at least 3 leads-ideally more than 4 leads-is necessary for minimizing the risk of failing to detect acute myocardial infarction occurring in a certain spatial location or direction Conclusions: By developing an AI model for detecting acute myocardial infarction with asynchronous ECG lead sets, we demonstrated the feasibility of multiple lead-based AI-enabled ECG algorithms on smartwatches for automated diagnosis of cardiac disorders. We also demonstrated the necessity of measuring at least 3 leads for accurate detection. Our results can be used as reference for the development of other AI models using sequentially measured asynchronous ECG leads via smartwatches for detecting various cardiac disorders. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

These include lack of explanations in clinically meaningful terms, handling the presence of unknown medical conditions, and transparency regarding the system’s limitations, both in terms of statistical performance as well as recognizing situations for which the system’s predictions are irrelevant. We articulate these unmet clinical needs as machine-learning (ML) problems and systematically address them with cutting-edge ML techniques. We focus on electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis as an example domain in which AI has great potential and tackle two challenging tasks: the detection of a heterogeneous mix of known and unknown arrhythmias from ECG and the identification of underlying cardio-pathology from segments annotated as normal sinus rhythm recorded in patients with an intermittent arrhythmia. We validate our methods by simulating a screening for arrhythmias in a large-scale population while adhering to statistical significance requirements. Specifically, our system 1) visualizes the relative importance of each part of an ECG segment for the final model decision--2) upholds specified statistical constraints on its out-of-sample performance and provides uncertainty estimation for its predictions--3) handles inputs containing unknown rhythm types--and 4) handles data from unseen patients while also flagging cases in which the model’s outputs are not usable for a specific patient. This work represents a significant step toward overcoming the limitations currently impeding the integration of AI into clinical practice in cardiology and medicine in general. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

The Cardiology Challenge database 2016 (PhysioNet) has been employed in this work. This dataset is established with the assumption that the phonocardiograms (PCG) are extracted concurrently with the electrocardiograms (ECG). For each heartbeat, the PCG record on a time-domain basis is segmented and is converted to images. Then, these images feed the proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) model to perform the classification. Most previous methods used traditional machine learning techniques to classify the heartbeats. These methods depend on feature extraction and selection methods that are sensitive to different colors, shapes, and sizes. CNN has the ability to achieve feature extraction and classification automatically, unlike traditional machine learning methods which require manual feature extraction, and the performance relies on the chosen features. The proposed is designed by integrating multiple ideas including parallel convolutional layers and residual links. To prove that the proposed model is beneficial in terms of feature extraction and classification, the extracted features have been used to train the SVM classifier. The results show that the model can offer acceptable and comparable accuracy of classification. It has outperformed the previous methods by achieving an accuracy of 93.49% and 94.66% with the SVM classifier. High performance could help id saving many people’s lives. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;CNN--Deep learning--Heart sound classification--PCG;Biomedical signal processing--Classification (of information)--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Electrocardiography--Extraction--Feature extraction--Heart--Support vector machines--Time domain analysis--Classification of heart sounds--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Feature extraction and classification--Heart sound classification--Heart sounds--Performance--Phonocardiograms--Sound classification--SVM classifiers--Cardiology;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85123400929

Although there is a lot of research in the medical sector, an efficient and reliable model to predict this disease at an early stage is still required. So, early diagnosis of heart disease is the most promising strategy for effective treatment. In this paper, we utilize the Genetic algorithm (GA) to select attributes, which are used as input for the machine learning algorithms Deep Learning(DL), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural network (NN), Naive Bayes (NB), and Logistic regression (LR). The two datasets of heart disease are used for model implementation. The results evaluation is measured using accuracy, precision, and f-measure.

It is important to detect heart disease effectively and reliably in order to avoid potential heart failures. Since heart failure is a major risk, it should be successfully treated in the early stages of heart disease. Many programs exist that can diagnose heart disease at an early stage using machine learning techniques. But these predictive systems are difficult to predict the heart conditions accurately with a minimum of time. Today, the stochastic gradient boosting with recursive feature elimination approach has been developed for feature selection. The results of the clustering were based on the adaptive Harris Hawk optimization algorithm. The selected features allowed us to better identify people with heart disease because they all have the same features. Classification is achieved using an improved deep genetic algorithm (EDGA). The system enhances the DNN's initial weights by using an augmented genetic algorithm and proposing the best initial weights for the DNN using neural network. The technique is illustrated using the publicly accessible dataset from the UCI machine learning repository. The study found that EDGA is well suited for predicting heart disease. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.;Clustering--Deep neural network--Feature selection--Heart disease--Optimization approach;Cardiology--Clustering algorithms--Genetic algorithms--Heart--Machine learning--Stochastic systems--Telemedicine--Cardio-vascular disease--Classification of heart disease--Machine learning techniques--Optimization algorithms--Publicly accessible--Recursive feature elimination--Stochastic gradient boosting--UCI machine learning repository--Diseases;Springer;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85102270686

Despite extensive research into its treatment, mortality remains high and has not decreased over time. Patients suffering from CS are highly heterogeneous. Developing an understanding of phenotypes among these patients is crucial for understanding this disease and appropriate treatments for individual patients. In this work, we develop a deep mixture of experts approach to jointly find phenotypes among patients with CS while simultaneously estimating their risk of in-hospital mortality. This model is applied to a cohort of 28,304 patients with CS, predicting in-hospital mortality with an AUROC of 0.85 ± 0.01 and discovering five phenotypes among the population. This approach allows for grouping patients in clinical clusters with different rates of device utilization and different risk of mortality. This approach jointly finds phenotypes within a clinical population and in modeling risk among that population. © 2021 IEEE;Cardiology--Knowledge engineering--Machine learning--Medical information systems--Neural networks;Cardiology--Hospitals--Machine learning--Medical informatics--Medical information systems--Mixtures--Risk perception--Cardiogenic shocks--Clinical population--Device utilization--Hospital mortality--Mixture of experts--Modeling risk--Neural-networks--Patient's suffering--Phenotyping--Diseases;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85125497539

For instance, the COVID-19 scare has reduced timely hospital admissions for ST-elevation myocardial infarction in Europe and the USA, causing unnecessary deaths and disabilities. While the emergency is still ongoing, enough efforts have been put to study and tackle this condition such that a comprehensive perspective and synthesis on the potential role of breakthrough healthcare technologies is possible. Indeed, current state-of-the-art information technologies can provide a unique opportunity to adapt and adjust to the current healthcare needs associated with COVID-19, either directly or indirectly, and in particular those of cardiovascular patients and practitioners. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We searched several biomedical databases, websites and social media, including PubMed, Medscape, and Twitter, for smartcare approaches suitable for application in the COVID-19 pandemic. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We retrieved details on several promising avenues for present and future healthcare technologies, capable of substantially reduce the mortality, morbidity, and resource use burden of COVID-19 as well as that of cardiovascular disease. In particular, we have found data supporting the importance of data sharing, model sharing, preprint archiving, social media, medical case sharing, distance learning and continuous medical education, smartphone apps, telemedicine, robotics, big data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning, with the ultimate goal of optimization of individual prevention, diagnosis, tracing, risk-stratification, treatment and rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: We are confident that refinement and command of smartcare technologies will prove extremely beneficial in the short-term, but also dramatically reshape cardiovascular practice and healthcare delivery in the long-term future, for COVID-19 as well as other diseases.

It is showing an increasing promise in medicine, study and treatment of diseases and injuries, to assist in data classification, novel disease symptoms and complicated decision making. Deep learning is one of form of machine learning typically implemented via multi-level neural networks. This work discusses the pros and cons of using DL in clinical cardiology that is also applied in medicine in general while proposing certain directions as more viable for clinical use. DL models called Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been applied to arrhythmias, electrocardiogram, ultrasonic analysis, genomes and endomyocardial biopsy. Convincingly, the results of the trained model are satisfactory, demonstrating the power of more expressive deep learning algorithms for clinical predictive modeling.

Early and accurate detection of the disease will help to save many valuable lives. The HD can be detected from medical tests, Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, heart sounds, Computed Tomography (CT) Images etc. Out of all types of detection of HD from ECG signals plays a vital role. In this paper, the ECG samples of the subjects have been considered as the required inputs to the HD detection model. In recent past, many useful articles have been reported for classification of HD using different machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. It is observed that with imbalanced HD data the detection accuracy is lower. With an objective to achieve better detection of HD, suitable DL and ML models have been identified in this paper and the required classification models have been developed and tested. The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model is chosen with an objective to deal with imbalanced data by generating and using additional fake data for detection purpose. Further, an ensemble model using long short-term memory (LSTM) and GAN is developed in this paper which demonstrates higher performance compared to individual DL model used in this paper. The simulation results using standard MIT-BIH show that the proposed GAN-LSTM model provides the highest accuracy, F1-score and area under curve (AUC) of 0.992, 0.987 and 0.984 respectively compared to other models. Similarly, for PTB-ECG dataset the GAN-LSTM model outperforms all other models with accuracy, F1-score and AUC of 0.994, 0.993 and 0.995 respectively. It is observed that out of the five models investigated, the GAN model performs the best whereas the detection potentiality of the NB model is the lowest. Further research work can be carried out by choosing all other different ensemble models and using other different datasets and the performance can be similarly obtained and compared. The proposed best detection methodology can also be applied to other diseases and healthcare problems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd;DL model--ECG samples-based HD detection--GAN--GAN-LSTM model--HD detection--Imbalanced ECG sample;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Computerized tomography--Diseases--Heart--Long short-term memory--Medical imaging--Adversarial networks--Deep learning model--Disease detection--Electrocardiogram sample-based heart disease detection--Generative adversarial network--Generative adversarial network-long short-term memory model--Heart disease--Heart disease detection--Imbalanced electrocardiogram sample--Short term memory--accuracy--Article--artificial neural network--Bayesian learning--deep learning--electrocardiogram--generative adversarial network--heart arrhythmia--heart disease--human--long short term memory network--machine learning--medical research--multilayer perceptron--short term memory--simulation--support vector machine--Electrocardiography;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85107046270

Several studies suggest an increased risk for COVID-19 patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases (CVD). However, it is challenging to quantify such risk factors and integrate them into patient condition evaluation. This paper presents machine learning methods to assess CVD risk scores from chest computed tomography together with laboratory data, demographics, and deep learning extracted lung imaging features to increase the outcome prediction accuracy for COVID-19 patients. The experimental results demonstrate an overall increase in prediction performance when the CVD severity score was added to the feature set.

When it comes to chronic diseases, worldwide, women continue to have poorer outcomes than men. The causes of these discrepancies have yet to be fully elucidated. Personalized medicine has transformed the way we identify and manage health-related issues. The big difference between traditional assessment of a situation and personalized medicine is the reliance of the multidimensional data (e.g., demographic, genetics) to make decisions about a treatment for individual patients. Predictive modeling with electronic health record (EHR) data is anticipated to drive personalized medicine and improve health care quality in general. Deep learning models could be used in a wide variety of predictive problems and settings in health care. In this chapter, we describe the role of big data analytics, machine learning, deep learning, and personalized medicine to improve women’s health.

The ability to diagnose a patient based on their heart sounds is a rather difficult skill to master. Thus, many approaches for automated heart auscultation have been explored. However, most of the previously proposed methods involve a segmentation step, the performance of which drops significantly for high pulse rates or noisy signals. In this work, we propose a novel segmentation-free heart sound classification method. Specifically, we apply discrete wavelet transform to denoise the signal, followed by feature extraction and feature reduction. Then, Support Vector Machines and Deep Neural Networks are utilised for classification. On the PASCAL heart sound dataset our approach showed superior performance compared to others, achieving 81% and 96% precision on normal and murmur classes, respectively. In addition, for the first time, the data were further explored under a user-independent setting, where the proposed method achieved 92% and 86% precision on normal and murmur, demonstrating the potential of enabling automatic murmur detection for practical use. © 2021 IEEE.;;Deep Learning--Heart Auscultation--Heart Sounds--Humans--Neural Networks, Computer--Wavelet Analysis--Deep neural networks--Discrete wavelet transforms--Heart--Support vector machines--Cardiovascular disease--Causes of death--Classification methods--Heart sounds--High pulse rate--Noisy signals--Pathologies detections--Performance--Rate signals--Sound classification--heart auscultation--heart sound--human--wavelet analysis--Cardiology;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;34891381;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85122510893

Traditionally, statistical models are used commonly in the risk prediction and assessment of CVD. However, the adoption of artificial intelligent (AI) approach is rapidly taking hold in the current era of technology to evaluate patient risks and predict the outcome of CVD. In this review, we outline various conventional risk scores and prediction models and do a comparison with the AI approach. The strengths and limitations of both conventional and AI approaches are discussed. Besides that, biomarker discovery related to CVD are also elucidated as the biomarkers can be used in the risk stratification as well as early detection of the disease. Moreover, problems and challenges involved in current CVD studies are explored. Lastly, future prospects of CVD risk prediction and assessment in the multi-modality of big data integrative approaches are proposed. © 2021;Artificial intelligence--Cardiovascular diseases--Deep learning--Machine learning--Risk prediction;Artificial Intelligence--Big Data--Cardiovascular Diseases--Humans--Risk Factors--Biomarkers--Cardiology--Deep learning--Forecasting--Health risks--Risk assessment--biological marker--'current--Artificial intelligent--Cardiovascular disease--Conventional approach--Deep learning--Machine-learning--Prediction and assessments--Risk prediction models--Risk predictions--Risks assessments--Article--artificial intelligence--cardiovascular disease--cardiovascular risk--deep learning--human--machine learning--nonhuman--artificial intelligence--cardiovascular disease--risk factor--Diseases;Elsevier Ireland Ltd;34077865;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85107136119

Annually 17900 thousand of peoples die due to heart problems. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the general term used for most of the heart diseases. There are two types of methods for diagnosing a CVD: (i) Invasive Methods (ii) Non-Invasive Methods. Coronary angiography is an invasive method for diagnosing a CVD which is a costly, painful and complicated process. A variety of Non-Invasive (NI) methods are available for diagnosing a CVD. NI methods generate a lot of data which is mainly of 3 kinds :(i) data based on clinical parameters, lab tests and symptoms (ii)data based on raw heart signals (ECG and PCG) (iii)data based on heart images. Majorly, three different machine learning (ML) frameworks may be developed based on the 3 types of data. First framework is simple and main concern is feature selection and classification. Second and third framework is complicated and requires a lot of techniques (preprocessing, segmentation and feature extraction) prior to classification of heart signals and images respectively. In this paper a comprehensive review is presented that summarizes some recent and prevalent machine learning methodologies in all the frameworks. Most of the papers reviewed in this study are from IEEE Explorer, Science Direct, PubMed, Springer, Hindawi, ACM digital library and MDPI libraries. It is found that Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are superseding in most of the studies in all the frameworks. Deep neural network is comparatively newer machine learning methodology which is giving prominent results in classifying heart sound signals and cardiovascular images. The present study will help to automate diagnosis process of heart disease by providing guidelines and avenues to new researchers in domain of machine learning. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.;Cardiovascular Disease--Classification--Feature Extraction--Feature Selection--Machine Learning--Non-Invasive Methods;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Deep learning--Deep neural networks--Diagnosis--Digital libraries--Diseases--Feature extraction--Heart--Image segmentation--Neural networks--Noninvasive medical procedures--Support vector machines--Cardiovascular disease--Clinical parameters--Coronary angiography--Feature selection and classification--Heart disease diagnosis--Heart sound signal--Non-communicable disease--Noninvasive methods--Learning systems;IOP Publishing Ltd;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85112477984

These applications include lung disease classification, electrocardiogram classification, electroencephalogram classification--forest cover classification, etc. All these applications rely on efficient feature selection capabilities of deep learning models. Models like convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long-short-term-memory (LSTM) etc. are used for this purpose. These models tend to evaluate all possible feature combinations via iterative window-based feature processing. Thereby trying to cover indefinite number of feature combinations in order to classify a definite number of features into a definite number of classes. All these models have a stopping-criteria, which depends upon the error rate difference of previous current iteration. If the error rate is less than a particular threshold, and number of iterations are above a certain predefined value, then training of these networks is stopped. This property of deep learning models limits their real-time performance, because training stops even if the accuracy is lower than expected. The reason for this low accuracy is high dimensionality of search space, due to which selection of the most optimum features is skipped. In order to reduce the probability of such conditions, this text proposes a bio-inspired Genetic Algorithm model for accuracy-based feature selection. The selected features are given to different deep learning models like LSTM RNN, and their internal performance is evaluated. Here, heart failure disease dataset from kaggle is used, and it is observed that due to pre-feature selection process, overall accuracy of these models is improved by 10, while precision, recall fMeasure scores are improved by 15 for heart disease data sets. The specificity and sensitivity performance is improved by 20 when compared with RNN and LSTM models individually.  © 2021 ACM.;Deep learning--Feature selection--Genetic algorithm--Support vector machine;Biomimetics--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Convolutional neural networks--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Feature extraction--Iterative methods--Long short-term memory--Support vector machines--Bio-inspired computing--Classification performance--Classification system--Deep learning--Error rate--Feature combination--Features selection--Higher efficiency--Learning models--Support vectors machine--Genetic algorithms;Association for Computing Machinery;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85119096552

While the automatic segmentation of blood vessels has been solved successfully, the automatic classification between arteries and veins (A/V) remains an unanswered question. There are some proposals that use artificial intelligence such as neural networks or methods based on deep learning, with very promising results. In this work we propose a novel method based on cellular automata with a neural network as a transition function, to classify artery and vein at the pixel level given the segmentation mask. The preliminary evaluation of this new method was carried out in a local database of 36 images, yielding an accuracy of 0.9650 and 0.9679 for arteries and veins classification, and a Dice similarity index above 0.7891 in the test set. The presented classification work paves the way for automated analysis of arteries and veins, which is specifically valuable in large data sets like our population-based sample.  © 2021 IEEE.;Artery/Vein classification--Automata classification--Cardiovascular diseases--Machine learning--Retinal images;Blood--Blood vessels--Cardiology--Cellular automata--Classification (of information)--Deep learning--Image classification--Image segmentation--Ophthalmology--Population statistics--Artery/vein classification--Automatic classification--Automatic segmentations--Automaton classification--Cardiovascular disease--Cellular automatons--Fundus image--Neural-networks--Retinal image--Retinal vasculature--Diseases;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85116105918

Accurate analytics for real-time heart disease is significant. This paper sought to develop a smart healthcare framework (SHDML) by using deep and machine learning techniques based on optimization stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to predict the presence of heart disease. The SHDML framework consists of two stage, the first stage of SHDML is able to monitor the heart beat rate condition of a patient. The SHDML framework to monitor patients in real-time has been developed using an ATmega32 Microcontroller to determine heartbeat rate per minute pulse rate sensors. The developed SHDML framework is able to broadcast the acquired sensor data to a Firebase Cloud database every 20 seconds. The smart application is infectious in regard to displaying the sensor data. The second stage of SHDML has been used in medical decision support systems to predict and diagnose heart diseases. Deep or machine learning techniques were ported to the smart application to analyze user data and predict CVDs in real-time. Two different methods of deep and machine learning techniques were checked for their performances. The deep and machine learning techniques were trained and tested using widely used open-access dataset. The proposed SHDML framework had very good performance with an accuracy of 0.99, sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.85, and F1-score of 0.87 © 2021 Elwahsh et al.

Many of these approaches are based on heartbeat analysis using a stethoscope and some of these are digitally analyzed. In an ordinary system, doctors use an acoustic stethoscope to detect any aberration in the heartbeat and predict atypical conditions of the human heart. One major problem is that the frequency range and intensity of the heart sounds are flat as well as the sound may contain noise. Hence, even a cardiac specialist doctor may encounter difficulties to analyze the heart sound perfectly. This paper describes a new methodology to detect heart diseases by examining heart sounds in real-time. We consider the guts sound as our input data. Our methodology uses a deep learning approach to determine whether a patient has any disease or is healthy. To achieve that, we integrated an electronic stethoscope and a software solution known as a heartbeat audio classifier. Our proposed system solution should be able to differentiate normal heartbeats and heart murmurs with a prediction of probable heart problem type in real-time. We believe our approach assists in reducing the cardiac arrest rate. © 2021 IEEE.;Cardiovascular Diseases--Convolutional Neural Network--Deep Neural Network--Electronic Stethoscope--Heartbeat Classifier Software--Spectrogram--Support Vector Machine;Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Electronic stethoscope--Frequency ranges--Heartbeat analysis--Learning approach--Research interests--Software solution--System solution--Work in progress--Heart;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85113755669

The patients face the problem of a delayed diagnosis as the subjects do not undergo routine tests and consult a doctor only after severe symptoms. Most medical expert systems are designed to aid the doctors in making wise decisions and only such data sets exist in the literature. We attack the problem of an early-stage diagnosis that can be done at the home by the subject himself on a routine basis, using a low cost and compact ECG sensor. Machine learning tools nowadays have become important for data processing and assistance in various fields including medicine. Attributed to an absence of data, we first developed our ECG dataset by collecting ECG signal data from 300 persons including 53 cardiac patients and 247 healthy persons, using a low-cost and compact ECG sensor. To detect the heart diseases from this data, classical methods (Random forest and Gradient boosting) and state of the art Deep Learning models (1D Convolution Neural Net) were used. A problem with machine learning in the specific context is a severe data imbalance, for which oversampling of minority data was used. Since the sensor is a low cost, noise can get added up. Hence, voting across multiple time windows is done to improve the results. After a healthy comparison between all classification methods with different techniques based on their test accuracy, 1D CNN with oversampling and using voting strategy comes out as the best classifiers with a 93% test accuracy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.;1D convolution neural net--ECG signal--Gradient boosting--Heart diseases--Machine learning--Medical expert systems--Oversampling--Random forest;Body sensor networks--Cardiology--Costs--Data handling--Decision trees--Deep learning--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Expert systems--Heart--Classical methods--Classification methods--Delayed diagnosis--Early-stage diagnosis--Gradient boosting--Medical expert system--Multiple time windows--Voting strategies--Learning systems;Springer;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85111656968

In interventional cardiology, the hope is for AI to provide automated analysis and deeper interpretation of data from electrocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and electronic health records, among others. Furthermore, high-performance predictive models supporting decision-making hold the potential to improve safety, diagnostic and prognostic prediction in patients undergoing interventional cardiology procedures. These applications include robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention procedures and automatic assessment of coronary stenosis during diagnostic coronary angiograms. Machine learning (ML) has been used in these innovations that have improved the field of interventional cardiology, and more recently, deep Learning (DL) has emerged as one of the most successful branches of ML in many applications. It remains to be seen if DL approaches will have a major impact on current and future practice. DL-based predictive systems also have several limitations, including lack of interpretability and lack of generalizability due to cohort heterogeneity and low sample sizes. There are also challenges for the clinical implementation of these systems, such as ethical limits and data privacy. This review is intended to bring the attention of health practitioners and interventional cardiologists to the broad and helpful applications of ML and DL algorithms to date in the field. Their implementation challenges in daily practice and future applications in the field of interventional cardiology are also discussed.

The success of these tools is dependent on the understanding of the intrinsic processes being used during the conventional pathway by which clinicians make decisions. In a parallelism with this pathway, ML can have an impact at four levels: for data acquisition, predominantly by extracting standardized, high-quality information with the smallest possible learning curve--for feature extraction, by discharging healthcare practitioners from performing tedious measurements on raw data--for interpretation, by digesting complex, heterogeneous data in order to augment the understanding of the patient status--and for decision support, by leveraging the previous steps to predict clinical outcomes, response to treatment or to recommend a specific intervention.

Here we show that a convolutional neural network trained on raw pixel data in 812,278 echocardiographic videos from 34,362 individuals provides superior predictions of one-year all-cause mortality. The model’s predictions outperformed the widely used pooled cohort equations, the Seattle Heart Failure score (measured in an independent dataset of 2,404 patients with heart failure who underwent 3,384 echocardiograms), and a machine learning model involving 58 human-derived variables from echocardiograms and 100 clinical variables derived from electronic health records. We also show that cardiologists assisted by the model substantially improved the sensitivity of their predictions of one-year all-cause mortality by 13% while maintaining prediction specificity.

Features extracted by a deep convolutional neural network are combined with hand-crafted features (demographic, morphological, and heart rate variability metrics) and fed into a multilayer perceptron. We employ an Asymmetric Loss (ASL) function, which enables the model to focus on hard but under-represented samples. To mitigate the issue of ground-truth mislabeling and to provide robustness, we investigate the use of a self-learning label correction method that iteratively estimates correct labels during training. Our team SMS+1 placed 7th on the unseen test set, with an overall challenge score of 0.51, and 0.52, 0.45, 0.50, 0.50, and 0.49 for twelve-, six-, four-, three-, and two-lead, respectively.

One of many steps to automatically detect CVDs using auscultation, concerns the detection and delimitation of the heart sound boundaries, a process known as segmentation. Whether to include or not a segmentation step in the signal classification pipeline is nowadays a topic of discussion. Up to our knowledge, the outcome of a segmentation algorithm has been used almost exclusively to align the different signal segments according to the heartbeat. In this paper, the need for a heartbeat alignment step is tested and evaluated over different machine learning algorithms, including deep learning solutions. From the different classifiers tested, Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) Network and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms are shown to be the most robust. Namely, these algorithms can detect the presence of heart murmurs even without a heartbeat alignment step. Furthermore, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms require an explicit segmentation step to effectively detect heart sounds and murmurs, the overall performance is expected drop approximately 5% on both cases. © 2021 IEEE.;;Algorithms--Heart Auscultation--Heart Sounds--Neural Networks, Computer--Support Vector Machine--Convolutional neural networks--Decision trees--Diagnosis--Heart--Image segmentation--Learning algorithms--Recurrent neural networks--Support vector machines--Cardiovascular disease--Classification algorithm--Convolutional neural network--Heart Murmur--Heart sounds--Machine learning algorithms--Screening procedures--Segmentation algorithms--Signal classification--Sound classification--algorithm--heart auscultation--heart sound--support vector machine--Cardiology;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;34891292;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85122536250

Heart diseases have emerged as one of the leading causes of death all over the world. According to the world health organization (WHO), millions of people are dying every year from heart-related diseases. A classification model that can early detect arrhythmia will be able to reduce this number by manyfold. Many researchers are working in this area and proposed many deep learning and machine Learning based models for arrhythmia classification. These models have high accuracy but require a machine with high computational power. Hence, these models are not sustainable options for the practical field. In this paper, we have proposed a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with high accuracy and low computational complexity. Our proposed methodology is appraised on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset. We achieved overall 98.25% accuracy into five classes with an f1 score of 98.24%, precision 97.58%, and recall 96.79% which is better than previous results classifying arrhythmia. We can claim that our proposed method is better than most other existing models because of the higher accuracy with a simple architecture that can be run on an edge device with relatively low hardware configuration.

This paper studies the binary classification between normal or abnormal heart sounds, and proposes a heart sound classification algorithm based on the joint decision of extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and deep neural network, achieving a further improvement in feature extraction and model accuracy. First, the preprocessed heart sound recordings are segmented into four status, and five categories of features are extracted from the signals based on segmentation. The first four categories of features are sieved through recursive feature elimination, which is used as the input of the XGBoost classifier. The last category is the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC), which is used as the input of long short-term memory network (LSTM). Considering the imbalance of the data set, these two classifiers are both improved with weights. Finally, the heterogeneous integrated decision method is adopted to obtain the prediction. The algorithm was applied to the open heart sound database of the PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology(CINC) Challenge in 2016 on the PhysioNet website, to test the sensitivity, specificity, modified accuracy and F score. The results were 93%, 89.4%, 91.2% and 91.3% respectively. Compared with the results of machine learning, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and other methods used by other researchers, the accuracy and sensibility have been obviously improved, which proves that the method in this paper could effectively improve the accuracy of heart sound signal classification, and has great potential in the clinical auxiliary diagnosis application of some cardiovascular diseases.;extreme gradient boosting--feature extraction--heart sound classification--long short-term memory network;Algorithms--Databases, Factual--Heart Sounds--Neural Networks, Computer--algorithm--factual database--heart sound;NLM (Medline);33899423;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85105069003

The current development of data mining schemes has offered several systems that concern on disease prediction. Even though the disease prediction system includes more advantages, there are still many challenges that might limit its realistic use, such as the efficiency of prediction and information protection. This paper intends to develop an improved disease prediction model, which includes three phases: Weighted Coalesce rule generation, Optimized feature extraction, and Classification. At first, Coalesce rule generation is carried out after data transformation that involves normalization and sequential labeling. Here, rule generation is done based on the weights (priority level) assigned for each attribute by the expert. The support of each rule is multiplied with the proposed weighted function, and the resultant weighted support is compared with the minimum support for selecting the rules. Further, the obtained rule is subject to the optimal feature selection process. The hybrid classifiers that merge Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Deep Belief Network (DBN) takes the role of classification, which characterizes whether the patient is affected with the disease or not. In fact, the optimized feature selection process depends on a new hybrid optimization algorithm by linking the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) with Dragonfly Algorithm (DA) and hence, the presented model is termed as Grey Wolf Levy Updated-DA (GWU-DA). Here, the heart disease and breast cancer data are taken, where the efficiency of the proposed model is validated by comparing over the state-of-the-art models. From the analysis, the proposed GWU-DA model for accuracy is 65.98 %, 53.61 %, 42.27 %, 35.05 %, 34.02 %, 11.34 %, 13.4 %, 10.31 %, 9.28 % and 9.89 % better than CBA + CPAR, MKL + ANFIS, RF + EA, WCBA, IQR + KNN + PSO, NL-DA + SVM + DBN, AWFS-RA, HCS-RFRS, ADS-SM-DNN and OSSVM-HGSA models at 60th learning percentage. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd;Disease prediction--Hybrid classification--Optimal feature selection--Weighted rule generation;Algorithms--Breast Neoplasms--Data Mining--Female--Heart Diseases--Humans--Support Vector Machine--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Data mining--Efficiency--Feature extraction--Forecasting--Metadata--Particle swarm optimization (PSO)--Predictive analytics--Support vector machines--Breast cancer data--Data transformation--Deep belief network (DBN)--Hybrid optimization algorithm--Information protection--Optimal feature selections--Prediction systems--Weighted supports--algorithm--Article--breast cancer--deep belief network--deep learning--feature selection--grey wolf optimization with dragonfly algorithm--heart disease--human--prediction--support vector machine--breast tumor--data mining--female--Diseases;Elsevier Ltd;34218121;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85111785604

Several time series based algorithms are reported to obtain characteristic features of PCG signals to facilitate prognostication and diagnosis of various heart diseases, with limited accuracy in classifying various heart sounds. Recently, machine learning based classification of PCG signals is gaining importance that can enable discriminating normal and diseased heart conditions. In this work, it was hypothesized that a deep learning model can discriminate normal heart sound and murmur. 30 samples each of normal PCG and heart sound signals with murmur from Peter Bentley Heart Sounds Database sampled at 44.1 kHz were used for analysis. A 4th order Butterworth low pass filter with cutoff frequency at 200 Hz was used to remove high frequency noise as suggested by the database. The spectrum of each PCG signal was obtained to train a convolutional neural network (CNN model for classification. The dataset was divided into 60% training, 20% validation and 20% testing. Accuracy of 77% was achieved using the test data in classifying the PCG based on the spectrum. Validation of this technique with larger dataset is required. The results motivate the analysis and comparison of normal PCG's with different cardiac conditions for cardiac disease diagnosis. © 2021 IAE All rights reserved.;Deep learning--Heart sound--Machine learning--PCG--Phonocardiogram;Biomedical signal processing--Butterworth filters--Classification (of information)--Convolutional neural networks--Cutoff frequency--Deep learning--Diseases--Heart--Low pass filters--Phonocardiography--Statistical tests--Condition--Deep learning--Diagnostic importances--Feasiblity--Heart Murmur--Heart sounds--PCG--PCG signal--Phonocardiograms--Spectra's--Article--classification algorithm--controlled study--convolutional neural network--data base--deep learning--diagnostic accuracy--feasibility study--heart murmur--heart sound--human--phonocardiography--power spectrum--recurrent neural network--signal processing--sound analysis--time series analysis--validation study--Cardiology;International Academic Express;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85118791391

Also, for health care automation deep learning and medical image processing is being proven as a boon for capturing and tracking accurate patient record and disease prediction. Heart sounds play a significant role in screening for heart disease. Because the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low--it is a problem that separates experts and takes time to estimate correct heart waves. Also, ECG verification is being done prominently for every kind of disease and abnormality, which is why monitoring accurate ECG and heart rate is very essential in proper diagnosis. Distinguishing the purpose of the heart is therefore essential. Here in the study, we combined conventional feature engineering methods with deep learning to automatically distinguish between normal and abnormal heart sounds. We proposed a one-dimensional convolution neural network (CNN) model that divides the ECG into abnormal heart sounds. We have used multilayer perceptron (MLP) for the classification of heart waves. Differentiation of heart sounds is implemented using the MATLAB framework.  © 2021 IEEE.;Classification--Deep Learning--Heartbeat--MATLAB--MLP--Neural Network;Biomedical signal processing--Computer aided diagnosis--Deep learning--Electrocardiography--Health care--Heart--Medical imaging--Signal to noise ratio--Deep learning--Heart disease--Heart sounds--Heartbeat--Machine-learning--Medical images processing--Multilayers perceptrons--Neural-networks--Patient record--Sound classification--Cardiology;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85128930150

Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a commonly employed non-invasive physiological signal used to screen and diagnose CVD. During recent years, remarkable advances in automated ECG interpretation techniques have been witnessed. In particular, deep learning (DL) models find useful to increase the disease diagnostic performance of CVD using the ECG signals. To explore and achieve effective ECG recognition, this paper presents a Class Imbalance handing with DL based Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for ECG Signal Recognition, named as CIGRU-ELM model. The presented CIGRU-ELM model involves preprocessing, data sampling, feature extraction, and classification. Primarily, data preprocessing takes place to convert the ECG report to valuable data and transform it into a compatible format for further processing. In addition, Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) based data sampling process takes place to handle the class imbalance problem. Besides, GRU based feature extractor is applied to extract a useful set of feature vectors.

An automated tool for vessel segmentation can assist clinicians and contribute to patient treatment scheduling. However, it is still a challenging problem due to various conditions existing in images such as pathology, noise and poor contrast. Deep learning architectures typically achieve the-state-of-the-art performances in machine vision applications due to high contextual feature generations. This paper introduces a deep learning architecture for fully automated blood vessel segmentation. We propose a novel model, called Sine-Net, that first applies up-sampling and then down-sampling for catching thin and thick vessel features, respectively. We also include residuals to carry more contextual information to the deeper levels of the architecture. Deep networks may perform better if inputs are appropriately pre-processed. Thus, we conduct tests on our network with and without pre-processing applied to input images. We present experimental validations on retinal images of 3 publicly available databases (STARE, CHASE_DB1 and DRIVE) and compare results in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and area under curve metrics. Our results demonstrate that Sine-Net outperforms the methods proposed in the literature in some of the metrics. In addition, the method has the potential to be used in clinical applications thanks to its decent execution time, high accuracy and robustness. © 2020 Karabuk University;Blood vessel segmentation--Deep learning--Fully convolutional neural network--Sine-Net;;Elsevier B.V.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85089357927

Heart disease is a condition that affects both men and women equally and may be a major cause of death around the world. Early diagnosis of this condition is critical for everyone in order to reduce mortality rates day by day. Chronic kidney disease dataset, from UCI machine learning library, having 1190 samples with 14 characteristics has been used for this study. To make this research more potent, both Machine learning (ML) and Deep learning (DL) techniques were used to detect the sickness early. The data was normalized by standard scaler for having a class varience issue. We then used three deep learning techniques namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) with two other general machine learning approaches such as Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM). To show a replication study, the overall experiments were done based on the three different random subsets. For the classification measurement, we also employ the ROC and the AUC curves. Several promising outcomes have been achieved. We calculated accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score.

Incorrect classification may lead to patient's death if the alarm is true or to disruption in patient care if false. There has been a body of research, as signified by the 2015 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge--due accomplishments have been made in the relevant computational technology, and yet the highest accuracy known thus far is in the mid-80% range (85%). Our work achieved much higher accuracy and, additionally, very early classification almost at the onset of an arrhythmia alarm, by utilizing state of the art deep learning methods. The machine learning model used is a Residual Network (ResNet) and a Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) connected in tandem.

For patients with suspected or known cardiovascular disease, several anatomical and functional imaging techniques are commonly performed to aid this endeavor, including coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and nuclear cardiology imaging. Continuous improvement in positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and CT hardware and software has resulted in improved diagnostic performance and wide implementation of these imaging techniques in daily clinical practice. However, the human ability to interpret, quantify, and integrate these data sets is limited. The identification of novel markers and application of machine learning (ML) algorithms, including deep learning (DL) to cardiovascular imaging techniques will further improve diagnosis and prognostication for patients with cardiovascular diseases. The goal of this position paper of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) and the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI) is to provide an overview of the general concepts behind modern machine learning-based artificial intelligence, highlights currently prefered methods, practices, and computational models, and proposes new strategies to support the clinical application of ML in the field of cardiovascular imaging using nuclear cardiology (hybrid) and CT techniques. © 2021, The Author(s).;Cardiovascular--Deep learning--Machine learning--Multimodality imaging--Position paper;Artificial Intelligence--Humans--Nuclear Medicine--Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography--Positron-Emission Tomography--Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon--Tomography, X-Ray Computed--Article--artificial intelligence--cardiac imaging--cardiovascular disease--clinical practice--computed tomographic angiography--human--image analysis--image processing--image reconstruction--image registration--image segmentation--machine learning--medical literature--multimodal imaging--phenotype--positron emission tomography-computed tomography--prognostic assessment--risk assessment--single photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography--software--artificial intelligence--nuclear medicine--positron emission tomography--single photon emission computed tomography--x-ray computed tomography;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;33864509;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85104892134

They are popularly deployed in cardiology for early and automatic detection of various life-threatening diseases. However, a machine learning algorithm requires a large volume of training data to create the learning model which is an empirical problem in medical domain. Generating synthetic patient data has emerged as an important area of research to solve the issue. In this paper, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture using medical domain knowledge to create realistic Electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms containing the signature of Atrial Fibrillation (AF), a common type of arrhythmia. Our composite architecture consists of a pair of GANs to simulate the disease-specific Heart Rate Variability (HRV) pattern and the unique signal morphology in the generated waveforms. The proposed architecture is applied on two public datasets for synthesis of AF-specific ECG to mitigate the class imbalance issue. Results show that the performance of existing AF classifiers significantly improves on both datasets by adding the synthetic data to the training set. © 2021 European Signal Processing Conference.

Arrhythmia is one of the most common heart diseases and hence it is of quintessential importance that there be computational systems that are able to automatically diagnose arrhythmia. ECG is a way of detecting the heart beat using electrical changes in the skin caused by the cardiac cycle. ECG can be used to automatically diagnose various heart diseases including arrhythmia. It is very well known that artificial intelligence is known as the 4th industrial revolution and various subfields of artificial intelligence such as machine learning and deep learning have been used to solve problems across a wide range of fields.

As the development of machine learning techniques, detection of CVDs by them from ECG and PCG has attracted much attention. However, current available methods are mostly based on single source data. It is desirable to develop efficient multi-modal machine learning methods to predict and diagnose CVDs. In this study, we propose a novel multi-modal method for predicting CVDs based both on ECG and PCG features. By building up conventional neural networks, we extract ECG and PCG deep-coding features respectively. The genetic algorithm is used to screen the combined features and obtain the best feature subset. Then we employ a support vector machine to implement classifications. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of our method is superior to those of single modal methods and alternatives.

Making full use of fully convolutional neural networks CNNs ability to operate pixel-wise classification, cine MRI sequences can be segmented and volumetric features of three key heart structures are computed for disease prediction. The three key heart structures are the left ventricle cavity, right ventricle cavity and the left ventricle myocardium. In this paper, we suggest an automated pipeline for both cardiac segmentation and diagnosis. The study was conducted on a dataset of 150 patients from Dijon Hospital in the context of the post-2017 Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention MICCAI, Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC). The challenge consists in two phases: (i) a segmentation contest, where performance is evaluated on dice overlap coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics, and a (ii) diagnosis contest for heart disease classification. For this aim, we propose the use of a deep learning based network for segmentation of the three key cardiac structures within short-axis cine MRI sequences and a classifier ensemble for heart disease classification. The deep learning segmentation network is a UNet fully convolutional neural network variant with fewer trainable parameters. The classifier ensemble consists in combining three classifiers, namely a multilayer perceptron, a random forest and a support vector machine. Before feeding the segmentation network, a preliminary step consists in localizing heart region and cropping input images to a restricted region of interest (ROI). This is achieved by a signal processing based approach and aims at reducing multi-class imbalance and computational load. We achieved nearly state of the art accuracy performances for both the segmentation and disease classification challenges. Reporting a mean dice overlap coefficient of 0.92 for the three cardiac structures segmentation, along with good limits of agreement for the various derived clinical indices, leading to an accuracy of 0.92 for the disease classification on unseen data. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd;Cardiac segmentation--Cine MRI--Classifier ensemble--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning;Heart--Heart Diseases--Heart Ventricles--Humans--Image Processing, Computer-Assisted--Magnetic Resonance Imaging--Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine--Neural Networks, Computer--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Computer aided diagnosis--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Decision trees--Deep learning--Diseases--Heart--Magnetic resonance imaging--Medical computing--Medical imaging--Multilayer neural networks--Noninvasive medical procedures--Support vector machines--Cardiac segmentation--Classifier ensembles--Computational loads--Disease classification--Left ventricle cavity--Medical image computing--Non-invasive assessments--Overlap coefficients--Article--cardiac imaging--cardiovascular magnetic resonance--cine magnetic resonance imaging--classifier--computer assisted diagnosis--convolutional neural network--deep learning--diagnostic accuracy--disease classification--heart disease--human--image processing--image segmentation--major clinical study--multilayer perceptron--priority journal--random forest--signal processing--support vector machine--validation process--diagnostic imaging--heart--heart disease--heart ventricle--nuclear magnetic resonance imaging--Image segmentation;Elsevier Ltd;33485057;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85100171320

The number of possible applications of Artificial Intelligence is also huge in clinical medicine and cardiovascular diseases. To describe for the first time in literature, the main results of articles about Artificial Intelligence potential for clinical applications in molecular imaging techniques, and to describe its advancements in cardiovascular diseases assessed with nuclear medicine imaging modalities. A comprehensive search strategy was used based on SCOPUS and PubMed databases. From all studies published in English, we selected the most relevant articles that evaluated the technological insights of AI in nuclear cardiology applications. Artificial Intelligence may improve patient care in many different fields, from the semi-automatization of the medical work, through the technical aspect of image preparation, interpretation, the calculation of additional factors based on data obtained during scanning, to the prognostic prediction and risk--group selection. Myocardial implementation of Artificial Intelligence algorithms in nuclear cardiology can improve and facilitate the diagnostic and predictive process, and global patient care. Building large databases containing clinical and image data is a first but essential step to create and train automated diagnostic/prognostic models able to help the clinicians to make unbiased and faster decisions for precision healthcare. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.;Artificial intelligence--Deep Learning--Machine-learning--Nuclear Cardiology--PET--Radiomics--SPECT;Artificial Intelligence--Cardiology--Cardiovascular Diseases--Humans--Molecular Imaging--Nuclear Medicine--Prognosis--ammonia n 13--fluorodeoxyglucose f 18--rubidium 82--sodium fluoride f 18--Article--artificial intelligence--artificial neural network--cardiology--cardiovascular disease--deep learning--health care--human--machine learning--molecular imaging--nuclear medicine--patient care--positron emission tomography--predictive value--radiomics--single photon emission computed tomography--artificial intelligence--cardiovascular disease--diagnostic imaging--molecular imaging--prognosis;Bentham Science Publishers;32564769;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85115040272

Recent studies have shown that moderate to severe PVL after TAVR significantly affects patients’ prognosis in a negative manner, and even mild PVL might be associated with increased long-term mortality. Therefore, in order to reduce the incidence of PVL during TAVR procedure, preoperative patient selection and preprocedural planning become very important. Most of the research has proven that some risk factors are highly correlated with PVL post-TAVR. Therefore, this chapter mainly introduces the predictive factors of PVL after TAVR and discusses how to apply recent novel techniques such as machine learning and deep learning to this issue, to help scientific researchers focus on the current situation of topic and future tendency. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Cardiovascular disorders are a common cause of heart failure. It is distinguished by the heart's inability to provide an appropriate amount of blood to the body. All main bodily processes are affected when there is insufficient blood flow. Heart failure is a disease or set of symptoms that cause the heart to weaken. The Main Findings of the research study lies on the three major factors--first, the timing of the patient's follow-up appointment for the condition is critical since early detection of a cardiovascular problem and treatment decreases the likelihood of death. It has an inverse relationship. The second most significant aspect is the ejection fraction. It is to be anticipated, given that it is essentially the efficiency of the heart. At last, the patient's age is the third most linked characteristic. Clearly, as one ages, the heart's function deteriorates. The Data is Modeled Using Machine learning with ANN, and an accuracy of about 80% obtained shows the Framework is fairly useful for the Detection of Cardiac Arrest. Further, the accuracy can be increased to 90-95% by using deep learning models  © 2021 IEEE.;blood--cardiovascular--heart--symptoms;Blood--Cardiology--Deep learning--Patient treatment--Applications of AI--Blood--Blood flow--Cardiac arrest--Cardiovascular--Follow up--Heart failure--Major factors--Research studies--Symptom--Heart;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85126486444

Clinical diagnosis can be based on the selected 2D key-frames from five views. Limited by the availability of multi-view data, most methods have to rely on the insufficient single view analysis. This study proposes to automatically analyze the multi-view echocardiograms with a practical end-to-end framework. We collect the five-view echocardiograms video records of 1308 subjects (including normal controls, ventricular septal defect (VSD) patients and atrial septal defect (ASD) patients) with both disease labels and standard-view key-frame labels. Depthwise separable convolution-based multi-channel networks are adopted to largely reduce the network parameters. We also approach the imbalanced class problem by augmenting the positive training samples. Our 2D key-frame model can diagnose CHD or negative samples with an accuracy of 95.4%, and in negative, VSD or ASD classification with an accuracy of 92.3%. To further alleviate the work of key-frame selection in real-world implementation, we propose an adaptive soft attention scheme to directly explore the raw video data. Four kinds of neural aggregation methods are systematically investigated to fuse the information of an arbitrary number of frames in a video. Moreover, with a view detection module, the system can work without the view records. Our video-based model can diagnose with an accuracy of 93.9% (binary classification), and 92.1% (3-class classification) in a collected 2D video testing set, which does not need key-frame selection and view annotation in testing. The detailed ablation study and the interpretability analysis are provided. The presented model has high diagnostic rates for VSD and ASD that can be potentially applied to the clinical practice in the future. The short-term automated machine learning process can partially replace and promote the long-term professional training of primary doctors, improving the primary diagnosis rate of CHD in China, and laying the foundation for early diagnosis and timely treatment of children with CHD. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.;Congenital heart disease--Multi-channel networks--Multi-view learning--Neural aggregation;Child--Echocardiography--Heart Defects, Congenital--Humans--Infant, Newborn--Machine Learning--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Diseases--Learning systems--Aggregation methods--Automated interpretation--Binary classification--Congenital heart disease--Multi-channel network--Professional training--Real-world implementation--Ventricular septal defect--Article--child--China--classification algorithm--computer assisted diagnosis--conceptual framework--controlled study--convolution algorithm--convolutional neural network--deep learning--diagnostic accuracy--diagnostic test accuracy study--early diagnosis--echocardiography--heart atrium septum defect--heart ventricle septum defect--human--image analysis--machine learning--major clinical study--parameters--priority journal--recurrent neural network--videorecording--congenital heart malformation--diagnostic imaging--echocardiography--newborn--Diagnosis;Elsevier B.V.;33418465;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85098981556

Compare to other deadly diseases, heart disease is one of the most lethal diseases, affecting the lives of millions of people worldwide. It is very important to detect heart disease must early so the loss of lives can be prevented. The availability of enormous amounts of data for medical diagnostics has aided in the development of complex learning-based models for automated early detection of cardiac problems. The classical machine learning approaches unable to generalize the new data sets which have not been seen in the training set. Therefore, the trained model has less accuracy in prediction stage. To minimize this issue, need to balance between training and testing datasets. This paper proposes a novel deep learning architecture using a 1D convolutional neural network for classification between healthy and non-healthy persons with balanced datasets to reduce the limitations of classical machine learning approach. Several clinical parameters are used for evaluating the risk contour in the patients which supports in early diagnosis. Various regularization methods are used to avoid overfitting in the proposed model. The proposed model achieves over 97% training accuracy and 96% test accuracy on the dataset. This is compared in detail with other machine learning algorithms using various performance parameters which proves the effectiveness of the proposed model.  © 2021 IEEE.;1D Convolutional Neural Network--Deep Learning--Embedding Layer--Health care--Heart Disease Prediction--Overfitting;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep neural networks--Diagnosis--Diseases--Health care--Heart--Learning algorithms--Multilayer neural networks--Network architecture--Statistical tests--1d convolutional neural network--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Embedding layer--Embeddings--Heart disease--Heart disease prediction--Learning architectures--Machine learning approaches--Overfitting--Forecasting;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85127436475

To reduce the risk of death, it is critical to analyze and predict heart diseases. The proposed approach introduces a novel technique to detect anomalies in Electrocardiogram signals and classify cardiac conditions (17 - classes) from 1000 fragments of ECG signals from 45 patients in the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. The proposed approach utilizes two methods, one approach based on conventional Machine learning algorithm i.e., SVM (Support Vector Machine) and while the deep learning method uses CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) based architecture (ALEXNET). Spectral power density was detected using Welch's process, and Discrete Fourier Transform. The data was standardized and scaled to a standard deviation of unity. On the test set, CNN classification accuracy was reported to be 87-90%, while SVM classification accuracy was recorded to be 70-76%. According to the literature this is the simplest approach with state-of-the-art deep learning method to achieve accuracy up to 90%.

It is the term for all types of diseases that affect the heart or blood vessels. Heart disease is a type of cardiovascular disease. It can be detected early by examining the arrhythmia presence. Arrhythmia is an abnormal heart rhythm that is commonly diagnosed and evaluated by analyzing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. In classical techniques, a cardiologist/clinician used an electrocardiogram (ECG) to monitor the heart rate and rhythm of patients then read the journal activity of patients to diagnose the presence of arrhythmias and to develop appropriate treatment plans. However, The classical techniques take time and effort. The development of arrhythmias diagnosis, toward computational processes, such as arrhythmias detection and classification by using machine learning and deep learning. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a popular method used to classify arrhythmia. Dataset pre-processing was also considered to achieve the best performance models. MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database was used as our dataset. Our study used the EfficientN et-V2 which is a type of convolutional neural network to perform the classification of five types of arrhythmias. In pre-processing, the ECG signal was cut each 1 second (360 data), signal augmentation is applied to balance the amount of data in each class, and then the Continues Wavelet Transform (CWT) is employed to transform the ECG signal into a scalogram. The dataset is then distributed into subsets by using modulo operation to get variants of data in each subset. The colormap is applied to convert scalograms into RGB images. By this scheme, our study achieved superior accuracy than the existing method, with an accuracy rate of 99.97%.  © 2021 TRON Forum.;arrhythmia--colormap--Continues Wavelet Transform (CWT)--EfficientNet-V2--scalogram;Blood vessels--Cardiology--Computer aided diagnosis--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Electrocardiography--Heart--Image classification--Patient treatment--Wavelet transforms--Arrhythmia classification--Cardiovascular disease--Classical techniques--Colormap--Continue wavelet transform--Convolutional neural network--Efficientnet-v2--Electrocardiogram signal--Scalogram--Wavelets transform--Diseases;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85125803089

We examine how AI and ML can be used as means of prevention in acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. We also evaluate how such novel advancements in technology can be used to calculate polygenic risk scores and potentially predict the risk of sudden cardiac death. We also discuss a novel dynamic approach to prevention based on objective lifestyle data. Despite the promise of AI and ML in medicine and cardiology, there are still several limitations that we discuss. In the near future, we believe that AI and ML-based applications in cardiovascular medicine will continue to mature and be able to support and augment our daily clinical practice, ultimately improving patient outcomes and satisfaction and reducing health care costs. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.;Acute coronary syndrome--Artificial intelligence--Atrial fibrillation--Cardiovascular disease prevention--Deep learning--Heart failure--Machine learning--Primary prevention--Sudden cardiac death--Wearables;;Springer International Publishing;;Book chapter;Scopus;2-s2.0-85122900300

Different patients are suitable for distinct references of vital signs due to the disease type and individual physique. Personalized Vital Signs Control (PVSC) helps clinicians with the recommendation of the optimal references for real-time treatment. However, a data-driven approach needs to overcome the unclear ground truth problem, requires complex feature integration and continuous value space, and is expected to ensure the safety of fragile patients. But none of the existing approaches can overcome all of these challenges simultaneously. This work emphasizes PVSC as a sequence decision-making problem and applies multiple reinforcement learning methods to it. We propose a novel adaptive medical control model. The model combines the deep deterministic policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm, supervised experience knowledge, and recurrent neural network module, named PVSC-RL.

Public datasets for electrocardiograms (ECGs) have existed since the 1980s and have been used for very specific tasks in cardiology, such as arrhythmia, ischemia, and cardiomyopathy detection. Recently, private institutions have begun curating large ECG databases that are orders of magnitude larger than the public databases for ingestion by deep learning models. These efforts have demonstrated not only improved performance and generalizability in these aforementioned tasks but also application to novel clinical scenarios. This review focuses on orienting the clinician towards fundamental tenets of deep learning, state-of-the-art prior to its use for ECG analysis, and current applications of deep learning on ECGs, as well as their limitations and future areas of improvement. © 2020 The Author(s).

To meet this need, we developed an interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for HFrEF screening using electrocardiography (ECG) and validated its performance. This retrospective cohort study included two hospitals. An AI algorithm based on a convolutional neural network was developed using 39,371 ECG results from 17,127 patients. The internal validation included 3,470 ECGs from 2,908 patients. Furthermore, we conducted external validation using 4,362 ECGs from 4,176 patients from another hospital to verify the applicability of the algorithm across different centers. The end-point was to detect HFrEF, defined as an ejection fraction <40%. We also visualized the regions in 12 lead ECG that affected HFrEF detection in the AI algorithm and compared this to the previously documented literature. During the internal and external validation, the areas under the curves of the AI algorithm using a 12 lead ECG for detecting HFrEF were 0.913 (95% confidence interval, 0.902-0.925) and 0.961 (0.951-0.971), respectively, and the areas under the curves of the AI algorithm using a single-lead ECG were 0.874 (0.859-0.890) and 0.929 (0.911-0.946), respectively. The deep learning-based AI algorithm performed HFrEF detection well using not only a 12 lead but also a single-lead ECG. These results suggest that HFrEF can be screened not only using a 12 lead ECG, as is typical of a conventional ECG machine, but also with a single-lead ECG performed by a wearable device employing the AI algorithm, thereby preventing irreversible disease progression and mortality.

However, its use in clinical practice is not straightforward due to its poor reproducibility with cases from daily practice, among other reasons. Objectives: To validate a new artificial intelligence tool in order to quantify the cardiac biventricular function (volume, mass, and EF). To analyze its robustness in the clinical area, and the computational times compared with conventional methods. Methods: A total of 189 patients were analyzed: 89 from a regional center and 100 from a public center. The method proposes two convolutional networks that include anatomical information of the heart to reduce classification errors. Results: A high concordance (Pearson coefficient) was observed between manual quantification and the proposed quantification of cardiac function (0.98, 0.92, 0.96 and 0.8 for volumes and biventricular EF) in about 5 seconds per study. Conclusions: This method quantifies biventricular function and volumes in seconds with an accuracy equivalent to that of a specialist. © 2021, Sociedad Argentina de Cardiologia.

As an efficient cure has not been available, early detection is integral for disease cure and control. Predictive algorithms are useful in this scenario. Here, estimation is performed on patients who are likely to come in contact with COVID-19 disease, using clinical predictive models with the help of deep learning. The most informative features are extracted from chest X-ray images for COVID-19 patients and non COVID-19 patients. These images are used for COVID detection. Patients with other chronic diseases are more vulnerable to COVID-19. Hence, we put forward a Heart Disease Prediction system based on machine learning algorithms.

Blood pressure is one of the four vital signs that provides important information regarding patients’ cardiovascular system conditions. Continuous and regular blood pressure monitoring is essential for early diagnosis and prevention of cardiovascular disease. Considering the existing invasive or cuff-based blood pressuring monitoring techniques in clinical practice, several studies have identified motivation and advantages of a new non-invasive and cuffless blood pressuring measurement technique using Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. In this study, we propose several systolic and diastolic blood pressure estimation models using recurrent neural networks with bidirectional connections and attention mechanism utilising only PPG signals. The models were evaluated on PPG and blood pressure signals derived from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II database. In the process, 22 characteristic features were extracted from the PPG waveform followed by various dimensionality reduction techniques to eliminate redundancies and reduce computational complexity. The proposed models were evaluated on both the 22-feature set and the reduced input feature vector, respectively. The models were compared with four machine learning techniques commonly used in the literature. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed models could capture the non-linear relationship between the PPG features and blood pressure with high accuracy and outperformed the conventional machine learning methods on both datasets. The results for all the proposed models were acceptable by the global standards set by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation for cuffless blood pressure estimation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;Blood pressure monitoring--Cuffless--Deep learning--Non-invasive;Blood--Blood pressure--Cardiology--Dimensionality reduction--Diseases--Health risks--Photoplethysmography--Pressure control--Recurrent neural networks--Bi-directional connections--Blood pressure estimation--Blood-pressure monitoring--Dimensionality reduction techniques--Machine learning techniques--Medical instrumentation--Non-linear relationships--Systolic and diastolic blood pressures--Article--blood pressure monitoring--comparative study--correlation coefficient--deep learning--diastolic blood pressure--dimensionality reduction--feature extraction--feature selection--feed forward neural network--gated recurrent unit network--human--long short term memory network--multiple linear regression analysis--photoelectric plethysmography--priority journal--random forest--recurrent neural network--recursive feature elimination--signal processing--systolic blood pressure--Learning systems;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85096880706

These algorithms are programmed to learn and identify patterns from “training data,” that can be subsequently applied to new datasets, without being explicitly programmed to do so. AI is revolutionising the field of medical imaging and in particular of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) by providing deep learning solutions for image acquisition, reconstruction and analysis, ultimately supporting the clinical decision making. Numerous methods have been developed over recent years to enhance and expedite CMR data acquisition, image reconstruction, post-processing and analysis--along with the development of promising AI-based biomarkers for a wide spectrum of cardiac conditions. The exponential rise in the availability and complexity of CMR data has fostered the development of different AI models. Integration in clinical routine in a meaningful way remains a challenge. Currently, innovations in this field are still mostly presented in proof-of-concept studies with emphasis on the engineering solutions--often recruiting small patient cohorts or relying on standardised databases such as Multi-ethnic Study on atherosclerosis (MESA), UK Biobank and others. The wider incorporation of clinically valid endpoints such as symptoms, survival, need and response to treatment remains to be seen. This review briefly summarises the current principles of AI employed in CMR and explores the relevant prospective observational studies in cardiology patient cohorts. It provides an overview of clinical studies employing undersampled reconstruction techniques to speed up the scan encompassing cine imaging, whole-heart imaging, multi-parametric mapping and magnetic resonance fingerprinting along with the clinical utility of AI applications in image post-processing, and analysis. Specific focus is given to studies that have incorporated CMR-derived prediction models for prognostication in cardiac disease. It also discusses current limitations and proposes potential developments to enable multi-disciplinary collaboration for improved evidence-based medicine. AI is an extremely promising field and the timely integration of clinician's input in the ingenious technical investigator's paradigm holds promise for a bright future in the medical field.

The features of these PPG signals can reflect the damage of hypertension to the arteries. We detected and graded hypertension by the degree of arterial damage, used the flngertips PPG signals of 219 patients from Guilin People's Hospital, the selected patients have been diagnosed into three categories: normal blood pressure, prehypertension, and hypertension. By comparing the grading accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of different models, it is shown that under the same data set and experimental platform, the model based on 14-layer deep convolutional neural network and support vector machine (Gaussian kernel, y=0.5, C=20) is superior to other algorithms, and the accuracy of the recognition of hypertension respectively reached 92.44% and 96.92%.

The first stage involves segmenting the phonocardiogram to detect fundamental heart sounds--after which features are extracted and classification is performed. Some researchers in the field argue the segmentation step is an unwanted computational burden, whereas others embrace it as a prior step to feature extraction. When comparing accuracies achieved by studies that have segmented heart sounds before analysis with those who have overlooked that step, the question of whether to segment heart sounds before feature extraction is still open. In this study, we explicitly examine the importance of heart sound segmentation as a prior step for heart sound classification, and then seek to apply the obtained insights to propose a robust classifier for abnormal heart sound detection. Furthermore, recognizing the pressing need for explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in the medical domain, we also unveil hidden representations learned by the classifier using model interpretation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that the segmentation which can be learned by the model plays an essential role in abnormal heart sound classification. Our new classifier is also shown to be robust, stable and most importantly, explainable, with an accuracy of almost 100% on the widely used PhysioNet dataset.  © 2013 IEEE.;Biomedical signal processing--heart sound segmentation--neural networks--phonocardiogram;Algorithms--Artificial Intelligence--Deep Learning--Phonocardiography--Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted--Anomaly detection--Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Extraction--Feature extraction--Heart--Phonocardiography--Computational burden--Heart sounds--Learning classifiers--Medical domains--Model interpretations--Phonocardiograms--PhysioNet--Three-stage process--Article--artificial intelligence--artificial neural network--calibration--classifier--congenital heart malformation--deep learning--electroencephalography--feature extraction--heart sound--human--learning algorithm--machine learning--nerve cell network--phonocardiography--qualitative analysis--signal processing--sound detection--speech intelligibility--steady state--support vector machine--training--waveform--algorithm--signal processing--Deep learning;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;32997637;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85107501980

Most existing pathological methods for the prognosis prediction are either costly or prone to misjudgement. Therefore, plenty of automated models based on machine learning have been proposed to predict the onset of cardiovascular disease with the premorbid information of patients extracted from their historical Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, it is a tough job to select proper features from longitudinal and heterogeneous EHRs, and also a great challenge to obtain accurate and robust representations for patients. In this paper, we propose an entirely end-to-end model called DeepRisk based on attention mechanism and deep neural networks, which can not only learn high-quality features automatically from EHRs, but also efficiently integrate heterogeneous and time-ordered medical data, and finally predict patients' risk of cardiovascular diseases. Experiments are carried out on a real medical dataset and results show that DeepRisk can significantly improve the high-risk prediction accuracy for cardiovascular disease compared with state-of-the-art approaches.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.;attention mechanism--cardiovascular diseases--deep neural network--High-risk prediction;Adult--Algorithms--Cardiovascular Diseases--Data Mining--Deep Learning--Electronic Health Records--Female--Humans--Male--Medical Informatics--Middle Aged--Neural Networks, Computer--Risk Assessment--Cardiology--Deep neural networks--Diagnosis--Diseases--Forecasting--Health risks--Attention mechanisms--Cardio-vascular disease--Electronic health record (EHRs)--End-to-end models--Medical dataset--Prognosis prediction--Risk predictions--State-of-the-art approach--adult--algorithm--cardiovascular disease--data mining--electronic health record--female--human--male--medical informatics--middle aged--procedures--risk assessment--Neural networks;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;31425047;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85107467560

Therefore, it is essential to inform people before disasters occurring to prevent and warn of abnormal conditions. In this paper, a deep learning approach was used to predict arterial events over the course of a few weeks/months prior to the event using a 5-min electrocardiogram (ECG) recording and extracting time–frequency features of ECG signals. Considering the possibility of learning long-term dependencies to identify and prevent these events as quickly as possible, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network was used. A Deep Belief Network (DBN) was also used to represent and select more efficient and effective features of the recorded dataset. This approach is briefly called LSTM-DBN. Four publicly available datasets in the field of health care were used to evaluate the proposed approach. These data were collected from wearable heart rate monitoring sensors along with demographic features in the context of the Internet of Things. The prediction results of the proposed LSTM-DBN were compared with other deep learning approaches (simple RNN, GRU, CNN and Ensemble), and traditional classification approaches (MLP, SVM, Logistic Regression and Random Forest). In addition, DBN performance was compared with other methods of feature selection and representation such as PCA and AutoEncoder. Experimental results showed that the proposed LSTM-DBN (88.42% mean accuracy) had significantly better performance in comparison with all other deep learning approaches and traditional classifications. © 2021, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.;Cardiovascular event prediction--Deep belief network--Internet of things--LSTM neural network--Wearable heart rate monitoring sensors;Cardiology--Decision trees--Disaster prevention--Electrocardiography--Feature extraction--Forecasting--Internet of things--Logistic regression--Long short-term memory--Patient monitoring--Support vector machines--Telemedicine--Abnormal conditions--Cardiovascular event--Classification approach--Deep belief network (DBN)--Demographic features--Heart-rate monitoring--Long-term dependencies--Myocardial Infarction--Deep learning;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85098690017

The current medical practice for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases is not suitable for long-term, out-of-hospital use. A key to long-term monitoring is the ability to detect abnormal cardiac rhythms, i.e., arrhythmia, in real-time. In this paper, we present our work in designing real-time sensing, and evaluating machine learning algorithms for real-time arrhythmia detection. Most of the existing work applies machine learning algorithms to electrocardiogram (ECG) images to detect abnormal patterns. These approaches are not suitable for real-time processing due to high processing overhead. In our work, we treat data as time series, and evaluate various machine learning algorithms in terms of both learning and computational performance. Our experimental results show that the long short-term memory network (LSTM) has both high accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating great potential for online detection of arrhythmia.  © 2020 IEEE.;Anomaly Detection--Big Data--Machine Learning--Smart Health;Big data--Cardiology--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Learning algorithms--Long short-term memory--Anomaly detection--Arrhythmia detection--Cardiovascular disease--Causes of death--Congestive heart failures--Heart attack--Machine learning algorithms--Machine-learning--Real- time--Smart health--Anomaly detection;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85099572049

Decision support systems could help health professionals to provide patients with quick and cost-efficient diagnostic analysis. The 2020 CinC Challenge challenges participants to develop such a tool for 12-lead ECG recordings. In this paper, an approach for a multi-stream neural network is presented. Two parallel models were trained with different input data to combine the two relevant paradigms in modern machine learning. A simple multilayer perceptron and a deep convolutional neural network were concatenated for the final classification. Since the data originated from different sources, an ensemble of models was trained. Due to technical difficulties, we (easyG) submitted a trimmed version and achieved a test score of -0.290, which ranked as the 39th entry. Validation score was 0.403. Although these results were mixed, offline 5-fold cross validation showed the potency of the full version.

Due to the unique pattern of cardiovascular diseases in Bangladesh, local health professionals are facing immense difficulties in both the cases of diagnosis and treatment. Machine learning and Deep Learning based approaches to diagnose CVD in early stages will surely provide an edge to tackle this alarming situation. But proper database of cardiovascular patients is still not established due to cost effectiveness (as per local perspective) and other local standpoints. The current situation of CVD has become a barrier to achieve Health Related Sustainable Development Goals set by the government of Bangladesh. Our research group is focused to solve this problem by proposing a new model to build a centralized CVD database after minutely analyzing the local health infrastructure. This cost effective and viable approach will surely lead the way for future machine learning and deep learning based researches in order to detect CVD in early stages for the benefit of local population. The benefit of such model goes beyond the boundaries of Bangladesh, as low income localities with infirm health infrastructure can also adapt such model to build centralized CVD database. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Android system--Biomedical engineering in developing countries--Biomedical engineering in developing countries--Central database--CVD--Medical instrumentation--Technologies for preventive healthcare--Technologies for preventive healthcare;Biochemical engineering--Cardiology--Cost effectiveness--Database systems--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Cardio-vascular disease--Current situation--Health professionals--Learning-based approach--Local perspective--Local populations--Middle-income countries--Research groups--Learning systems;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85104831750

Firstly, the non-linear transformation was performed on the linear prediction coefficients according to the Mel scale to obtain the spectral characteristic parameters of the heart sound signal. Secondly, the feature parameters were processed by differential processing and weighted reorganization to complete a 2-D feature map. Finally, the deep learning models, such as Inception_v4 was used to perform classification of heart sound signal. The experimental results showed that the algorithm performs better than the several existing algorithms. An accuracy of 93.7%, a sensitivity of 95.6%, and a specificity of 89.5 % were achieved using the proposed method in this work. It is expected to be used for machine-assisted diagnosis of the initial diagnosis of congenital heart disease. © 2020 IEEE.;deep learning--feature extraction--heart sound signal--linear prediction coefficient--mel filter;Cardiology--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Forecasting--Heart--Linear transformations--Mathematical transformations--Classification of heart sounds--Congenital heart disease--Feature parameters--Heart sound signal--Linear prediction coefficients--Mel frequencies--Non-linear transformations--Spectral characteristics--Biomedical signal processing;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85101697237

Cardiology is at the forefront of AI in medicine. For this review, we searched PubMed and MEDLINE databases with no date restriction using search terms related to AI and cardiology. Articles were selected for inclusion on the basis of relevance. We highlight the major achievements in recent years in nearly all areas of cardiology and underscore the mounting evidence suggesting how AI will take center stage in the field. Artificial intelligence requires a close collaboration among computer scientists, clinical investigators, clinicians, and other users in order to identify the most relevant problems to be solved. Best practices in the generation and implementation of AI include the selection of ideal data sources, taking into account common challenges during the interpretation, validation, and generalizability of findings, and addressing safety and ethical concerns before final implementation. The future of AI in cardiology and in medicine in general is bright as the collaboration between investigators and clinicians continues to excel. © 2020 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research;;Artificial Intelligence--Cardiology--Forecasting--Heart Diseases--Humans--achievement--artificial intelligence--cardiology--computer scientist--human--Medline--review--systematic review--artificial intelligence--cardiology--forecasting--heart disease--procedures;Elsevier Ltd;32370835;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85083881628

It is the most observed dimension of health among others such as social, intellectual, emotional, spiritual and environmental dimensions.Due to exponential increase in the development of wireless communication techniques, Internet of Things (IoT) has effectively penetrated different aspects of human lives. Healthcare is one of the dynamic domains with ever-growing demands which can be met by IoT applications. IoT can be leveraged through several health service offerings such as remote health and monitoring services, aided living, personalized treatment, and so on. In this scenario, Deep Learning (DL) models are employed in proficient disease diagnosis. The current research work presents a new IoT-based physical health monitoring and management method using optimal Stacked Sparse Denoising Autoencoder (SSDA) technique i.e., OSSDA. The proposed model utilizes a set of IoT devices to collect the data from patients. Imbalanced class problem poses serious challenges during disease diagnosis process. So, the OSSDA model includes SyntheticMinority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) to generate artificialminority class instances to balance the class distribution. Further, the hyperparameter settings of the OSSDA model exhibit heavy influence upon the classification performance of SSDA technique. The number of hidden layers, sparsity, and noise count are determined by Sailfish Optimizer (SFO). In order to validate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed OSSDA technique, a set of experiments was conducted on diabetes and heart disease datasets. The simulation results portrayed a proficient diagnostic outcome from OSSDA technique over other methods. The proposed method achieved the highest accuracy values i.e., 0.9604 and 0.9548 on the applied heart disease and diabetes datasets respectively. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

Approximately 17.1 million cases of deaths due to CVD were reported in 2004, this accounts for 29% of the global deaths. Nearly 7.2 million of these cases were related to myocardial heart disease. Thus any approach that could assist in identification of heart disease at preliminary stage is of the utmost importance in improving this elevating index. The work is an advancement in this domain by providing an approach for classification of heart audio samples using some state of the art deep learning techniques. It aims at implementing some existing segmentation techniques along with feature engineering in the audio domain. It also involves a comparative analysis of some existing machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient boosting trees, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) along with the deep learning techniques like Convolutional networks(CNN), and recurrent networks like simple Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN), Long Short Term Memory(LSTM). The precision values used to report the model performance comes out to be best for the HybridCNN with about precision of 1 for artifact, 0.906 for normal and 0.859 for murmur category. © 2020 IEEE.;CNN--CVD--Gammatone Frequency Cepstral Coefficient Recurrent networks--LSTM--Mel-Freq Cepstral Coefficient--Phonocardiograms--SVM--XGBoost;Adaptive boosting--Audio acoustics--Cardiology--Convolutional neural networks--Diseases--Heart--Learning systems--Long short-term memory--Support vector machines--Audio classification--Cardio-vascular disease--Comparative analysis--Convolutional networks--Feature engineerings--Learning techniques--Segmentation techniques--Simple recurrent neural networks--Deep learning;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85102490111

Objective: We investigated whether a machine learning system could perform systematic reviews more efficiently. Methods: All systematic reviews and meta-analyses of interventional randomized controlled trials cited in recent clinical guidelines from the American Diabetes Association, American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association (2 guidelines), and American Stroke Association were assessed. After reproducing the primary screening data set according to the published search strategy of each, we extracted correct articles (those actually reviewed) and incorrect articles (those not reviewed) from the data set. These 2 sets of articles were used to train a neural network–based artificial intelligence engine (Concept Encoder, Fronteo Inc). The primary endpoint was work saved over sampling at 95% recall (WSS@95%). Results: Among 145 candidate reviews of randomized controlled trials, 8 reviews fulfilled the inclusion criteria. For these 8 reviews, the machine learning system significantly reduced the literature screening workload by at least 6-fold versus that of manual screening based on WSS@95%. When machine learning was initiated using 2 correct articles that were randomly selected by a researcher, a 10-fold reduction in workload was achieved versus that of manual screening based on the WSS@95% value, with high sensitivity for eligible studies. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve increased dramatically every time the algorithm learned a correct article. Conclusions: Concept Encoder achieved a 10-fold reduction of the screening workload for systematic review after learning from 2 randomly selected studies on the target topic. However, few meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials were included. Concept Encoder could facilitate the acquisition of evidence for clinical guidelines. © Tomohide Yamada, Daisuke Yoneoka, Yuta Hiraike, Kimihiro Hino, Hiroyoshi Toyoshiba, Akira Shishido, Hisashi Noma, Nobuhiro Shojima, Toshimasa Yamauchi.;Clinical guideline--Deep learning--Evidence-based medicine--Machine learning--Meta-analysis--Neural network--Systematic review;Algorithms--Guidelines as Topic--Humans--Machine Learning--Mass Screening--Neural Networks, Computer--Workload--algorithm--artificial intelligence--cardiologist--cerebrovascular accident--comparative study--controlled study--convolutional neural network--data extraction--deep neural network--diabetes mellitus--dimensionality reduction--heart failure--human--medical society--practice guideline--randomized controlled trial (topic)--receiver operating characteristic--register--Review--screening--singular value decomposition--support vector machine--systematic review--validation study--workload--machine learning--mass screening--practice guideline--workload;JMIR Publications Inc.;33262102;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85098590614

Coronary artery segmentation, as an important part of quantitative researc h on coronary heart disease, has become the main topic in coronary artery analysis. In this paper, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based method called Coronary Artery U-net (CAU-net) is proposed for the automatic segmentation of coronary arteries in digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images. CAU-net is a variant of U-net. Based on the observation that coronary arteries are composed of many vessels with the same appearance but different thicknesses, a novel multi-scale feature fusion method is proposed in CAU-net. Besides, a new dataset is proposed to solve the problem of no available public dataset on coronary arteries segmentation, which is also one of our contributions. Our dataset contains 538 image samples, which is relatively large compared with the public datasets of other vessel segmentation tasks. In our dataset, a new labeling method is applied to ensure the purity of the labeling samples. From the experimental results, we prove that CAU-net can make significant improvements compared with the vanilla U-net, and achieve the state-of-the-art performance compared with other traditional segmentation methods and deep learning methods. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Coronary artery--Machine learning--Segmentation;Angiography--Cardiology--Convolution--Deep learning--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Heart--Image segmentation--Large dataset--Learning systems--Automatic segmentations--Coronary artery segmentation--Coronary heart disease--Digital substraction angiographies--Digital subtraction angiography--Multi-scale features--Segmentation methods--State-of-the-art performance--Convolutional neural networks;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85097097521

This unique feature is very suitable for some particular situations, such as burn patient monitoring. Currently, electrocardiogram (ECG) is still the most common approach for monitoring heart disease. Deep learning algorithms have already been applied to classifying ECG recordings and have achieved good diagnostic results. However, it is very rare to see deep learning-based heartbeat classification using radar signals. The reason is a lack of radar-based heart disease datasets, which are the most important part of training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the ECG recordings and radar signals are heterogeneous--thus, the ECG dataset cannot train the CNN for directly classifying the radar signals. In this paper, we propose a novel signal processing algorithm called the Common Features Extraction Method (CFEM) to extract the common features of ECG recordings and radar signals to train a CNN for radar heartbeat signal classification. By using CFEM, the ECG dataset is transferred to the radar field, which means that the core issue for training the CNN using radar signals has been solved. Practical experiments show that the CFEM-based CNN can classify heartbeat radar signals accurately. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Learning algorithms--Millimeter wave devices--Millimeter waves--Patient monitoring--Radar signal processing--Common features--Emerging technologies--Heartbeat classifications--Heartbeat monitoring--Heartbeat signals--Millimetre-wave radar--Signal processing algorithms--Unique features--algorithm--artificial neural network--cardiovascular disease--classification--machine learning--radar altimetry--signaling--wave field--Biomedical signal processing;Taylor and Francis Ltd.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85091341483

In earlier works, time-domain features, frequency-domain features, and a combination of the two have been used with classifiers such as logistic regression and support vector machines. However, more recently, deep learning techniques have outperformed these conventional feature engineering and classification techniques in various applications. This work explores the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for detecting sleep apnea segments. CNN is an image classification technique that has shown robust performance in various signal classification applications. In this work, we use it to classify one-dimensional heart rate variability signal, thereby utilizing a one-dimensional CNN (1-D CNN). The proposed technique resizes the raw heart rate variability data to a common dimension using cubic interpolation and uses it as a direct input to the 1-D CNN, without the need for feature extraction and selection. The performance of the method is evaluated on a dataset of 70 overnight ECG recordings, with 35 recordings used for training the model and 35 for testing. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 88.23% (AUC=0.9453) in detecting sleep apnea epochs, outperforming several baseline techniques. © 2020 IEEE.;;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Electrocardiography--Engineering education--Extraction--Feature extraction--Frequency domain analysis--Heart--Interpolation--Logistic regression--Sleep research--Statistical tests--Support vector machines--Support vector regression--Time domain analysis--Classification technique--Feature engineerings--Feature extraction and selection--Heart rate variability--Heart rate variability signals--Learning techniques--Signal classification--Time domain features--Biomedical signal processing;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85091048138

Early screening of HF has important implication for treatment in a timely manner. Heart sound (HS) conveys relevant information related to HF--this study is therefore based on the analysis of HS signals. The objective is to develop an efficient tool to identify subjects of normal, HF with preserved ejection fraction and HF with reduced ejection fraction automatically. Methods: We proposed a novel HF screening framework based on gated recurrent unit (GRU) model in this study. The logistic regression-based hidden semi-Markov model was adopted to segment HS frames. Normalized frames were taken as the input of the proposed model which can automatically learn the deep features and complete the HF screening without de-nosing and hand-crafted feature extraction. Results: To evaluate the performance of proposed model, three methods are used for comparison. The results show that the GRU model gives a satisfactory performance with average accuracy of 98.82%, which is better than other comparison models. Conclusion: The proposed GRU model can learn features from HS directly, which means it can be independent of expert knowledge. In addition, the good performance demonstrates the effectiveness of HS analysis for HF early screening. © 2020 The Author(s).;Deep learning--Gated recurrent unit--Heart failure screening--Heart sound;Heart Failure--Heart Sounds--Humans--Mass Screening--Models, Cardiovascular--Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted--Stroke Volume--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Failure (mechanical)--Hydraulic structures--Markov processes--Signal analysis--Cardio-vascular disease--Comparison models--Gated recurrent unit--Heart failure--Heart sound analysis--Heart sounds--Hidden semi-Markov modeling--Logistic regressions--Article--controlled study--diagnostic accuracy--diagnostic test accuracy study--feature extraction--fully convolutional network--gated recurrent unit network--hand crafted feature extraction--heart failure with preserved ejection fraction--heart failure with reduced ejection fraction--heart sound--hidden Markov model--human--intermethod comparison--logistic regression analysis--long short term memory--priority journal--recurrent neural network--support vector machine--biological model--heart failure--heart stroke volume--mass screening--pathophysiology--signal processing--Heart;BioMed Central Ltd.;31931811;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85078242599

In recent years, the wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has provided a comprehensive data source for intelligent clinical applications including the TEP investigated in this study. Method: We examined the problem of using a large volume of heterogeneous EHR data to predict treatment effects and developed an adversarial deep treatment effect prediction model to address the problem. Our model employed two auto-encoders for learning the representative and discriminative features of both patient characteristics and treatments from EHR data. The discriminative power of the learned features was further enhanced by decoding the correlational information between the patient characteristics and subsequent treatments by means of a generated adversarial learning strategy. Thereafter, a logistic regression layer was appended on the top of the resulting feature representation layer for TEP. Result: The proposed model was evaluated on two real clinical datasets collected from the cardiology department of a Chinese hospital. In particular, on acute coronary syndrome (ACS) dataset, the proposed adversarial deep treatment effect prediction (ADTEP) (0.662) exhibited 1.4, 2.2, and 6.3% performance gains in terms of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) over deep treatment effect prediction (DTEP) (0.653), logistic regression (LR) (0.648), and support vector machine (SVM) (0.621), respectively. As for heart failure (HF) case study, the proposed ADTEP also outperformed all benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed model achieved competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models in tackling the TEP problem. Conclusion: In this work, we propose a novel model to address the TEP problem by utilizing a large volume of observational data from EHR. With adversarial learning strategy, our proposed model can further explore the correlational information between patient statuses and treatments to extract more robust and discriminative representation of patient samples from their EHR data. Such representation finally benefits the model on TEP. The experimental results of two case studies demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods. © 2020, The Author(s).;Adversarial learning--Deep learning--Electronic health records--Treatment effect prediction;Acute Coronary Syndrome--Deep Learning--Electronic Health Records--Heart Failure--Humans--Logistic Models--acute coronary syndrome--electronic health record--heart failure--human--statistical model;BioMed Central Ltd;33317502;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85097547050

Detection of arrhythmia on an extended duration electrocardiogram (ECG) is done based on initial algorithmic software screening, with final visual validation by cardiologists. It is a time consuming and subjective process. Therefore, fully automated computer-assisted detection systems with a high degree of accuracy have an essential role in this task. In this study, we proposed an effective deep neural network (DNN) model to detect different rhythm classes from a new ECG database. Methods: Our DNN model was designed for high performance on all ECG leads. The proposed model, which included both representation learning and sequence learning tasks, showed promising results on all 12-lead inputs. Convolutional layers and sub-sampling layers were used in the representation learning phase. The sequence learning part involved a long short-term memory (LSTM) unit after representation of learning layers. Results: We performed two different class scenarios, including reduced rhythms (seven rhythm types) and merged rhythms (four rhythm types) according to the records from the database. Our trained DNN model achieved 92.24% and 96.13% accuracies for the reduced and merged rhythm classes, respectively. Conclusion: Recently, deep learning algorithms have been found to be useful because of their high performance. The main challenge is the scarcity of appropriate training and testing resources because model performance is dependent on the quality and quantity of case samples. In this study, we used a new public arrhythmia database comprising more than 10,000 records. We constructed an efficient DNN model for automated detection of arrhythmia using these records. © 2020;12-lead ECG--Arrhythmia detection--Deep neural networks--Ecg signals;Algorithms--Arrhythmias, Cardiac--Electrocardiography--Humans--Neural Networks, Computer--Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted--Software--Database systems--Deep learning--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Learning algorithms--Automated detection--Cardiac arrhythmia--Clinical problems--Computer assisted detection--High degree of accuracy--Neural network model--Software screening--Training and testing--Article--automation--computer assisted diagnosis--convolutional neural network--data base--deep neural network--diagnostic accuracy--electrocardiogram--feature learning (machine learning)--heart arrhythmia--heart rhythm--human--long short term memory network--sequence learning--algorithm--electrocardiography--heart arrhythmia--signal processing--software--Long short-term memory;Elsevier Ireland Ltd;32932129;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85090584970

It is challenging for most of the physicians to diagnose at an early stage to avoid the risk of death rate. The main objective of this study involves the prediction of heart disease by using efficient techniques based on feature selection and classification. For feature selection, the enhanced genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) have been implemented. For classification, the recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) has been implemented in this study. The data set used is the Cleveland heart disease data set available on UCI machine learning repository, and the performance of the proposed techniques has been evaluated by using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and f-measure. Finally, the results thus obtained have been compared with the existing models in terms of accuracy. It has been observed that LSTM when combined with PSO showed an accuracy of 93.5% whereas the best known existing model had an accuracy of 93.33%. Therefore, the proposed approach can be applied in the medical field for accurate heart disease prediction. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;Deep neural network--Genetic algorithm--Heart disease prediction--Long short term memory--Particle swarm optimization--Recurrent neural network;Cardiology--Diseases--Feature extraction--Forecasting--Genetic algorithms--Heart--Learning systems--Long short-term memory--Particle swarm optimization (PSO)--Death rates--Enhanced genetic algorithms--Feature selection and classification--Heart disease--Medical fields--Prediction of heart disease--Recurrent neural network (RNN)--UCI machine learning repository--Deep learning;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85102614553

In the last decade, the classification and prediction of heart diseases according to ECG signals has gained great importance for patients and doctors. In this paper, the deep learning architecture with high accuracy and popularity has been proposed in recent years for the classification of Normal Sinus Rhythm, (NSR) Abnormal Arrhythmia (ARR) and Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) ECG signals. The proposed architecture is based on Hybrid Alexnet-SVM (Support Vector Machine). 96 Arrhythmia, 30 CHF, 36 NSR signals are available in a total of 192 ECG signals. In order to demonstrate the classification performance of deep learning architectures, ARR, CHR and NSR signals are firstly classified by SVM, KNN algorithm, achieving 68.75% and 65.63% accuracy. The signals are then classified in their raw form with LSTM (Long Short Time Memory) with 90.67% accuracy.

Besides, any error in diagnosis of cardiac disease can be dangerous and risks an individual's life. Accurate diagnosis is therefore critical in cardiology. Data Mining (DM) classification techniques have been used to diagnosis heart diseases but still limited by some challenges of data quality such as inconsistencies, noise, missing data, outliers, high dimensionality and imbalanced data. Data preprocessing (DP) techniques were therefore used to prepare data with the goal of improving the performance of heart disease DM based prediction systems. Objective: The purpose of this study is to review and summarize the current evidence on the use of preprocessing techniques in heart disease classification as regards: (1) the DP tasks and techniques most frequently used, (2) the impact of DP tasks and techniques on the performance of classification in cardiology, (3) the overall performance of classifiers when using DP techniques, and (4) comparisons of different combinations classifier-preprocessing in terms of accuracy rate. Method: A systematic literature review is carried out, by identifying and analyzing empirical studies on the application of data preprocessing in heart disease classification published in the period between January 2000 and June 2019. A total of 49 studies were therefore selected and analyzed according to the aforementioned criteria. Results: The review results show that data reduction is the most used preprocessing task in cardiology, followed by data cleaning. In general, preprocessing either maintained or improved the performance of heart disease classifiers. Some combinations such as (ANN + PCA), (ANN + CHI) and (SVM + PCA) are promising terms of accuracy. However the deployment of these models in real-world diagnosis decision support systems is subject to several risks and limitations due to the lack of interpretation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.;Cardiac datasets--Cardiology--Data preprocessing--Datamining--Literature review;Cardiology--Data Mining--Heart Diseases--Humans--Cardiology--Computer aided diagnosis--Data mining--Decision support systems--Diseases--Heart--Support vector machines--Classification technique--Data preprocessing--Diagnosis decision--High dimensionality--Performance of classifier--Prediction systems--Preprocessing techniques--Systematic literature review--cardiology--classifier--clinical practice--clinical research--data classification--data preprocessing--data processing--deep learning--diagnostic accuracy--disease classification--empiricism--evidence based practice--feature selection--heart disease--human--intermethod comparison--machine learning--prediction--publication--Review--systematic review--task performance--cardiology--data mining--Classification (of information);Elsevier Ireland Ltd;32652383;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85087500300

Numerous studies have reported the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and even mortality in people consuming cannabis. However, not much attention has been paid to understand the cannabis-induced alteration in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, which can help in the early diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. The current study investigated the alteration in the ANS activity of 200 Indian male volunteers due to the consumption of bhang (a cannabis-based product) using heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. The results suggested a reduction in the variability of the heart rate, increased sympathetic dominance, and a corresponding reduction in the parasympathetic activity in the bhang consuming population, which may lead to various cardiovascular diseases. These inferences can act as evidence for counseling people to stop consuming cannabis. The study further proposes a machine learning model for automated identification of the bhang consuming population. The HRV parameters were subjected to weight-based feature ranking and dimension reduction methods to select suitable inputs for the machine learning models. After comparing the performances of the Naïve Bayes (NB), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Linear Regression (LR), Fast Large Margin (FLM), Deep Learning (DL), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosted Tree (GBT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), a GBT model was finally chosen as the best model. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;Autonomic nervous system--Cannabis--Gradient boosted tree--Heart rate variability--Machine learning;Cardiology--Decision trees--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Heart--Support vector machines--Support vector regression--cannabis--Automated identification--Autonomic nervous system--Cardio-vascular disease--Dimension reduction method--Early diagnosis--Generalized linear model--Heart rate variability--Machine learning models--adult--Article--automation--autonomic nervous system function--cannabis use--cardiovascular disease--cardiovascular risk--counseling--field work--heart rate variability--human--Indian--machine learning--male--parasympathetic function--priority journal--sympathetic function--Learning systems;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85088035923

Since then, the development of artificial intelligence has in part been shaped by the field of neuroscience. By understanding the human brain, scientists have attempted to build new intelligent machines capable of performing complex tasks akin to humans. Indeed, future research into artificial intelligence will continue to benefit from the study of the human brain. While the development of artificial intelligence algorithms has been fast paced, the actual use of most artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in biomedical engineering and clinical practice is still markedly below its conceivably broader potentials. This is partly because for any algorithm to be incorporated into existing workflows it has to stand the test of scientific validation, clinical and personal utility, application context, and is equitable as well. In this context, there is much to be gained by combining AI and human intelligence (HI). Harnessing Big Data, computing power and storage capacities, and addressing societal issues emergent from algorithm applications, demand deploying HI in tandem with AI. Very few countries, even economically developed states, lack adequate and critical governance frames to best understand and steer the AI innovation trajectories in health care. Drug discovery and translational pharmaceutical research stand to gain from AI technology provided they are also informed by HI. In this expert review, we analyze the ways in which AI applications are likely to traverse the continuum of life from birth to death, and encompassing not only humans but also all animal, plant, and other living organisms that are increasingly touched by AI. Examples of AI applications include digital health, diagnosis of diseases in newborns, remote monitoring of health by smart devices, real-time Big Data analytics for prompt diagnosis of heart attacks, and facial analysis software with consequences on civil liberties. While we underscore the need for integration of AI and HI, we note that AI technology does not have to replace medical specialists or scientists and rather, is in need of such expert HI. Altogether, AI and HI offer synergy for responsible innovation and veritable prospects for improving health care from prevention to diagnosis to therapeutics while unintended consequences of automation emergent from AI and algorithms should be borne in mind on scientific cultures, work force, and society at large. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.";Artificial intelligence--Automation--Biomedical engineering--Deep learning--Health care innovation--Neural networks;Algorithms--Animals--Artificial Intelligence--Automation--Big Data--Biomedical Engineering--Humans--Intelligence--Medicine--algorithm--artificial intelligence--automation--big data--biomedical engineering--cardiology--clinical practice--computer vision--cytology--decision making--deep learning--dermatology--drug research--Food and Drug Administration--gastroenterology--health care system--hospital readmission--human--immunotherapy--machine learning--mental health--natural language processing--neuroscience--non invasive procedure--ophthalmology--pathology--priority journal--radiology--reasoning--regenerative medicine--Review--scientist--speech discrimination--tissue engineering--vision--animal--artificial intelligence--biomedical engineering--intelligence--medicine--physiology--procedures;Mary Ann Liebert Inc.;31313972;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85084721758

Research Question: We hypothesized that the presence of isolated PE may signal a chronically elevated risk of arterial thrombotic disease. Study Design and Methods: Data from the VTEval Study, a prospective cohort study enrolling individuals with clinical suspicion and imaging-based diagnosis or exclusion of VTE, were analyzed. Patients with PE received whole-leg ultrasonography to assess presence of DVT. Regularized logistic regression identified features that discriminate between isolated PE and other VTE phenotypes at clinical presentation. Survival analyses were performed to evaluate the crude and adjusted 3-year risks of arterial thrombotic disease, recurrent VTE, and death. Results: The sample comprised 510 patients. Isolated PE patients (n = 63) had a distinct clinical profile from patients with other VTE phenotypes (n = 447). COPD, peripheral artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease were significantly more prevalent among patients with isolated PE. Isolated PE patients had significantly higher risk (incidence rate ratio vs DVT-associated PE, 3.7 (95% CI, 1.3-10.8, P = .009)--vs isolated DVT, 4.8 (1.7-14.3, P = .001) of arterial thrombotic events (ie, myocardial infarction, stroke/transient ischemic attack). After adjustment for clinical profile and medication intake, the risk of arterial thrombotic events for patients with isolated PE remained quadruple that of other VTE phenotypes (hazard ratio [HR], 3.8 [1.3-10.9], P = .01). Interpretation: Patients with isolated PE are at higher risk for arterial thrombosis and may require screening for arterial disease and development of novel therapeutic strategies.

The use of AI has already shown promise in a wide variety of fields in medicine including cardiology, renal medicine, critical care, and mental health. For a variety of reasons, cancer is an area where AI is expected to have a significant impact in the near term, and cancer is in many ways an obvious choice for enhancing the “reputation” of AI-based approaches in healthcare. First, cancer is common and imposes a considerable burden in terms of physical disability, emotional trauma, and economic cost for patients and society as a whole. Thus, almost without exception, across all cancer subtypes, there is a critical need to improve cancer-related outcomes. Second, at the individual level, there is huge patient demand for enhanced cancer diagnostics, prognostication, and therapy--cancers represent a major and indiscriminate cause of morbidity and mortality, and they evoke fear in a way that few other conditions do, because of the perception of cancer as a fatal diagnosis. From the cancer clinician’s perspective, there is an equally urgent drive since tumor heterogeneity and the exponential growth in onco-therapeutic options present major challenges in terms of decision making, not least due to sheer data burden. Rather alarmingly, it has been estimated that the modern-day cancer physician would need to spend in excess of 20 hours per day reading, in order to stay up to date with developments in the scientific literature. This challenge is well exemplified by current attempts to unravel the cancer genome-millions of molecular disparities are now coming to light that could, alone or in combination, influence cancer cell survival and progression, but harnessing these discoveries in a meaningful way is impossible without state-of-the-art computing. The impact of AI approaches is also expected to be significant for academia, where cancer research initiatives are likely to be more precisely steered by AI-based data-mining discoveries. This in turn is likely to mean that certain avenues of research in terms of cancer diagnostics and therapy are “shelved” either permanently or temporarily until new developments emerge that suggest otherwise. Furthermore, it is anticipated that for the pharmaceuticals industry, anticancer drug development and the development of companion diagnostics will benefit from an additional layer of premarket delivery validation, through AI-based analyses of actual and simulated clinical outcomes. One can thus appreciate that all stakeholders within the cancer health space stand to make potentially significant gains with the application of AI solutions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

This review focuses on recent advancements in applying machine learning (ML) in ECG and echocardiography and potential synergistic ML integration of ECG and echocardiography. Recent Findings: ML algorithms have been used in ECG for technical quality assurance, arrhythmia identification, and prognostic predictions, and in echocardiography to recognize image views, quantify measurements, and identify pathologic patterns. Synergistic application of ML in ECG and echocardiograph has demonstrated the potential to optimize therapeutic response, improve risk stratification, and generate new disease classification. There is mounting evidence that ML potentially outperforms in disease diagnoses and outcome prediction with ECG and echocardiography when compared with trained healthcare professionals. Summary: The applications of ML in ECG and echocardiography are playing increasingly greater roles in medical research and clinical practice, particularly for their contributions to developing novel diagnostic/prognostic prediction models. The automation in data acquisition, processing, and interpretation help streamline the workflows of ECG and echocardiography in contemporary cardiology practice. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.;Cardiovascular disease--Classification--Deep learning--Echocardiography--Electrocardiography--Machine learning;Algorithms--Cardiology--Echocardiography--Electrocardiography--Humans--Machine Learning--algorithm--automation--cardiology--cardiovascular disease--cardiovascular risk--clinical practice--data processing--deep learning--diagnostic value--disease classification--disease marker--echocardiography--electrocardiography--health care personnel--heart arrhythmia--human--image analysis--machine learning--measurement--medical research--outcome assessment--prediction--predictive value--prognosis--quality control--Review--risk assessment--standardization--treatment response--cardiology--echocardiography--machine learning;Springer;33037949;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85092350841

Machine learning techniques are widely applied to a variety of problems, including detection, characterization, prediction and simulation, in general with promising results. In the last years, the Big Data + Deep Learning binomial is getting most of the attention in academia and industry, but on many occasions this approach fails on capitalizing all the knowledge acquired in previous decades of research. This article, written as a companion to the keynote with the same title presented in the CinC 2020 conference, tries to illustrate the importance of exploiting expert knowledge and classical approaches in synergy with the most advanced deep learning methods, which by themselves have fundamental limitations. The discussion is built around the AF detection problem and the conclusions extracted from the Physionet/CinC Challenge 2017, but the main points can be relevant in other problems for which humans have a better answer than computers, and this answer can be described. © 2020 Creative Commons--the authors hold their copyright.;;Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Atrial fibrillation--Automatic Detection--Classical approach--Computer science and engineerings--Detection problems--Fundamental limitations--Machine learning techniques--Prediction and simulations--Learning systems;IEEE Computer Society;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85100933070

There have been several researches on using machine learning techniques for analyzing ECG. However, they need additional computation owning to ECG signals challenges. We introduce a new architecture of 1-D convolution neural network (CNN) to diagnose arrhythmia diseases automatically. The proposed architecture consists of four convolution layers, three pooling layers, and three fully connected layers evaluated on the arrhythmia dataset. All previous researches are conducted to classify healthy people from people with Arrhythmia disease. In this paper, we propose to go further multiclass classification with two classes of cardiac diseases and one class of healthy people.

To solve these problems, we developed an active balancing mechanism (ABM) based on valuable information contained in the biomedical data. ABM adopts the Gaussian naïve Bayes method to estimate the object samples and entropy as a query function to evaluate sample information and only retains valuable samples of the majority class to achieve under-sampling. The Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt diagnostic electrocardiogram (ECG) database, including 5,173 normal ECG samples and 26,654 myocardial infarction ECG samples, is applied to verify the validity of ABM. At imbalance rates of 13 and 5, experimental results reveal that ABM takes 7.7 seconds and 13.2 seconds, respectively. Both results are significantly faster than five conventional under-sampling methods. In addition, at the imbalance rate of 13, ABM-based data obtained the highest accuracy of 92.23% and 97.52% using support vector machines and modified convolutional neural networks (MCNNs) with eight layers, respectively. At the imbalance rate of 5, the processed data by ABM also achieved the best accuracy of 92.31% and 98.46% based on support vector machines and MCNNs, respectively. Furthermore, ABM has better performance than two compared methods in F1-measure, G-means, and area under the curve. Consequently, ABM could be a useful and effective approach to deal with imbalanced data in general, particularly biomedical myocardial infarction ECG datasets, and the MCNN can also achieve higher performance compared to the state of the art. © 2020 ACM.;Biomedical--entropy--Gaussian naïve Bayes--imbalanced data--myocardial infarction;Balancing--Cardiology--Convolutional neural networks--Data handling--Electrocardiography--Multilayer neural networks--Query processing--Support vector machines--Area under the curves--Biomedical fields--Classification models--Effective approaches--Myocardial Infarction--Physikalisch-technische bundesanstalt--Predictive modeling--Sample information--Deep learning;Association for Computing Machinery;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85084731753

This inconstancy affects the scheduler's ability to accurately estimate consultation length, which, in turn, hinders effective utilization of the clinic's resources and timely access to care. The objectives of this study were to: (i) predict the consultation length by accounting for its semicontinuous nature (i.e., zero in case of no-shows and positive otherwise), using machine learning (ML) algorithms, (ii) identify important features for predicting no-shows and non-zero consultation length, and (iii) assess the impact of integrating the ML-based prediction with the appointment scheduling system. Methods: We used two-years of data extracted from the electronic medical records of a cardiology clinic. By leveraging 16 predictors pertaining to the patient, appointment, and doctor, a two-part ML-based approach was developed to handle the semicontinuous consultation length. Supervised classification models were employed to predict no-shows (i.e., categorize the consultation length as zero or positive), and regression algorithms were developed for estimating non-zero consultation lengths. Three algorithms, namely, random forests, stochastic gradient boosting, and deep neural networks, were individually employed for both no-show classification and positive consultation length prediction. Finally, the best performing classification and regression models were combined to establish the complete two-part model, and its prediction error on new data is benchmarked against the clinic's current performance. The evaluation metrics for classification models were area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR). The prediction performance of regression algorithms was evaluated by mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). A simulation modeling approach was adopted to ascertain the effectiveness of using ML-based prediction for scheduling decisions as opposed to the clinic's current strategy. Results: Among the classification models tested, stochastic gradient boosted classification tree (SGBCT) demonstrated best performance (AUC-ROC = 0.85, AUC-PR = 0.64). For positive consultation length prediction, deep neural network regressor (DNNR) resulted in lowest prediction error (MAE = 8.55, RMSE = 6.88, MAPE = 12.24). The complete two-part model (SGBCT + DNNR) outperformed the clinic's approach to consultation length estimation by achieving 50 % and 52 % reduction in RMSE and MAE, respectively. Further adopting it for appointment scheduling could reduce the patient waiting time and doctor idle time by 56 % and 52 %, respectively. Besides, several clinical insights, along with critical features for no-show and consultation length prediction, were also identified from our proof-of-concept study. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that routine clinical tasks such as estimation of consultation length and no-shows can be accurately predicted using ML algorithms, and subsequently integrated into the clinical scheduling system to improve resource utilization and reduce patient waiting time. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.;Appointment scheduling--Cardiology clinic--Clinical decision support system--Consultation length prediction--Machine learning--No-shows;Appointments and Schedules--Cardiology--Data Science--Humans--Machine Learning--Referral and Consultation--Cardiology--Data Analytics--Decision trees--Deep neural networks--Errors--Mean square error--Medical computing--Neural networks--Regression analysis--Scheduling--Stochastic models--Stochastic systems--Supervised learning--Boosted classification trees--Electronic medical record--Mean absolute percentage error--Prediction performance--Receiver operating characteristic curves--Root mean squared errors--Stochastic gradient boosting--Supervised classification--adult--article--cardiology--clinical article--clinical decision support system--consultation--deep neural network--electronic medical record--female--human--male--prediction--proof of concept--random forest--recall--receiver operating characteristic--simulation--stochastic model--hospital management--machine learning--patient referral--Forecasting;Elsevier Ireland Ltd;33099184;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85096614511

The explanations consist of meaningful features to the user, namely contextual features. We instantiate our approach in the scenario of automated electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis and analyze the explanations generated in terms of interpretability and robustness. The proposed method uses a noise-insertion strategy to quantify the impact of intervals and segments of the ECG signals on the automated classification outcome. These intervals and segments and their impact on the diagnosis are common place to cardiologists, and their usage in explanations enables a better understanding of the outcomes and also the identification of sources of mistakes. The proposed method is particularly effective and useful for modern deep learning models that take raw data as input. We demonstrate our method by explaining diagnoses generated by a deep convolutional neural network. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Cardiology--Explainability--Machine learning;Automation--Convolutional neural networks--Data mining--Deep learning--Deep neural networks--Electrocardiography--Automated classification--Automated diagnosis--Classification models--Contextual feature--ECG signals--Identification of sources--Interpretability--Learning models--Learning systems;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85103250436

The 2020 PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge addresses the topic of automated classification of 12-lead ECG. Methods: Two machine learning strategies were implemented: a feature engineering approach based on the engineering of physiological features (or 'digital biomarkers') and a deep learning approach. Two sets of features were engineered: (1) capturing the interval variation between consecutive heartbeats, commonly called heart rate variability (HRV) measures and (2) using morphological biomarkers (e.g. QT interval, QRS width). A total of 16 HRV and 97 morphological biomarkers were implemented in python for each lead. A random forest (RF) model was trained using 5-fold cross validation to optimize the model hyperparameters. For the deep learning approach, a residual neural network (ResNet) architecture was used. The RF and ResNet were also combined in an ensemble learning (EL). The dataset was divided into 80%-20% stratified training-test sets. Results: on the local test set we achieved a Challenge score of 0.65 using the FE approach, 0.52 using the DL approach and 0.66 using the EL approach. For technical reasons we did not manage to score our models on the Challenge hidden test set. © 2020 Creative Commons--the authors hold their copyright.;;Biomarkers--Cardiology--Decision trees--Deep learning--E-learning--Electrocardiography--Engineering education--Statistical tests--Automated classification--Cross validation--Ensemble learning--Feature engineerings--Heart rate variability--Learning approach--Medical practice--Physiological features--Learning systems;IEEE Computer Society;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85100923703

To find out heart disease early, it can be detected by examining the presence or absence of arrhythmias. Arrhythmia is an abnormal heart beat rhythm, can beat too fast, too slow, or beat with irregular patterns, so that the arrhythmia has many types. To diagnose arrhythmias, one method that can be used is by analyzing ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals. Currently, doctors and medical personnel analyze ECG signals manually. Because the number of cardiologist paramedics is far less than the number of patients, patients need hardware or software to analyze the heart independently. With the development of technology in this era, there is a technology called Deep Learning. Deep Learning is a development of Machine Learning. In this paper, we proposed one method of Deep Learning, namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is used to classify 5 types of arrhythmias on ECG signals, that are: Normal Beat (NOR), Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB), Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB), Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC) and Fusion of Ventricular and Normal (FVN). Evaluating the performance of our CNN architecture, we tested it to classify the heart beat in the MIT BIH Arrhythmia database. The performance results of our proposed have highest accuracy is 98.6% with the following details: 713 Normal Beat samples can be detected correctly (100%), RBBB 689 samples (96.63%), LBBB 710 samples (99.58%), FVN 713 samples (100%), and PVC 690 samples (96.77%). © 2020 IEEE.;Arrhythmia--CNN--ECG--Heartbeat classification--Spectogram;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Electrocardiography--Heart--Arrhythmia classification--Convolution neural network--Convolutional neural network--Electrocardiogram signal--Heart disease--Heartbeat classifications--Network-based--Performance--Premature ventricular contraction--Spectogram--Diseases;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85099644635

In this study, we propose a framework referred to as smart forecasting CardioWatch (SCW) to measure the heart-rate variation (HRV) for patients with myocardial infarction (MI) who live alone or are outside their homes. In this study, HRV is used as a vital alarming sign for patients with MI. The performance of the proposed framework is measured using machine learning and deep learning techniques, namely, support vector machine, logistic regression, and decision-tree classification techniques. The results indicated that the analysis of heart rate can help health services that are located remotely from the patient to render timely emergency health care. Further, taking more cardiac parameters into account can lead to more accurate results. On the basis of our findings, we recommend the development of health-related software to aid researchers to develop frameworks, such as SCW, for effective provision of emergency health. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

Diagnosis of patients could be wrong, missed, or delayed if laboratory tests are performed erroneously. However, recognizing the value of correct laboratory test ordering remains underestimated by policymakers and clinicians. Nowadays, artificial intelligence methods such as machine learning and deep learning (DL) have been extensively used as powerful tools for pattern recognition in large data sets. Therefore, developing an automated laboratory test recommendation tool using available data from electronic health records (EHRs) could support current clinical practice. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop an artificial intelligence–based automated model that can provide laboratory tests recommendation based on simple variables available in EHRs. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the National Health Insurance database between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2013, was performed. We reviewed the record of all patients who visited the cardiology department at least once and were prescribed laboratory tests. The data set was split into training and testing sets (80:20) to develop the DL model. In the internal validation, 25% of data were randomly selected from the training set to evaluate the performance of this model. Results: We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, precision, recall, and hamming loss as comparative measures. A total of 129,938 prescriptions were used in our model. The DL-based automated recommendation system for laboratory tests achieved a significantly higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCmacro and AUROCmicro of 0.76 and 0.87, respectively). Using a low cutoff, the model identified appropriate laboratory tests with 99% sensitivity. Conclusions: The developed artificial intelligence model based on DL exhibited good discriminative capability for predicting laboratory tests using routinely collected EHR data. Utilization of DL approaches can facilitate optimal laboratory test selection for patients, which may in turn improve patient safety. However, future study is recommended to assess the cost-effectiveness for implementing this model in real-world clinical settings. ©Md Mohaimenul Islam, Hsuan-Chia Yang, Tahmina Nasrin Poly, Yu-Chuan Jack Li.;Artificial intelligence--Clinical decision-support system--Deep learning--Laboratory test--Patient safety;;JMIR Publications Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85097466229

Fast and accurate mortality prediction for Heart Failure is essential to improve the health care of patients and prevent them from death. However, due to the imbalance problem and poor feature representation in Heart Failure data, mortality prediction of Heart Failure is difficult with some simple models. To handle these problems, this study is focused on proposing a fast and accurate Heart Failure mortality prediction framework. Methods: This paper proposes a feature rearrangement based deep learning system for heart failure mortality prediction. The proposed framework improves the performance of predicting heart failure mortality by handling imbalance problem and achieving better feature representation. This paper also proposes a method named Feature rearrangement based convolutional layer, which demonstrates that the order of the input features is essential for the convolutional network. Results: The proposed system is experimentally evaluated on real-world Heart Failure data collected from the EHR system of Shanghai Shuguang Hospital, where 10,198 in-patients records are extracted between March 2009 and April 2016. Internal comparison results illustrate that the proposed framework achieves the best performance for Heart Failure mortality prediction. Extensive experimental results compared with other machine learning methods demonstrate that the proposed method has the highest average accuracy and area under the curve while predicting the three goals of in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, and 1-year mortality. Finally, top 12 essential clinical features are mined with their chi-square scores, which can help to assist clinicians in the treatment and research of heart failure. Conclusions: The proposed method successfully predict different target in three observation windows. Feature rearrangement based convolutional layer and Focal loss are employed into the proposed framework, which helps promote the prediction accuracy of Heart Failure death.

Delineation of right- and left-sided cavities, as well as major vessels, is an important step in clinical cardiology for cardiac disease diagnosis. Medical imaging provides a noninvasive diagnostic tool to study cardiac anatomy and detect pathological changes that occur in disease states such as dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and right ventricular dysfunction. The accurate automation of the corresponding task can accelerate the diagnostic part and assist in therapy decisions. In this chapter, we overview recent machine learning approaches that have been applied for automatic cardiac diagnosis based on deep learning and generative adversarial networks and explain the recent application of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for classification, detection, segmentation, registration, image reconstruction, and synthetization mostly in cardiovascular imaging. In continuum, we review the public cardiac dataset with open challenges and conclude the chapter with GAN limitations and future research directions. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Deep learning models for heartbeat arrhythmia detection, therefore, have been proposed and investigated during the past few years, they have good results on some data-sets concerning arrhythmia detection and classification, some even outperformed human doctors. However, like most deep learning models, the underlying mechanism has not been justified and explained very well, for example, we cannot interpret the decision momentum of certain models. Concerning that, we developed a general feature extraction framework for ECG data, it can perform various kinds of feature engineering tasks, all of the features have their meaning under a clinical context. We distilled the features on a large ECG data-set, then these features were fed into a Bayesian Neural Network for training. The BNN has a sparsity-inducing prior distribution arranged in a tied manner to learn the importance of every feature concerning the outcome. We evaluated this method for a classification problem and made a comparison between the way our model makes decisions and how field experts do for the same problem, we were able to find out that a) the features extracted from raw ECG data using our framework can be used as an indication for specific heartbeat arrhythmia, b) the mechanism of the model can be interpreted as a decision making procedure by weighing relative metrics just like human experts do, c) the weight of the features extracted from raw ECG data can be used to build a knowledge tree for guidance on diagnosing of certain heartbeat disease.  © 2013 IEEE.;Artificial neural networks--Bayesian inference--Bayesian neural networks (BNNs)--biomedical computing--ECG classification;Artificial life--Bayesian networks--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Data mining--Decision making--Deep learning--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Learning systems--Trees (mathematics)--Arrhythmia detection--Bayesian neural networks--Decision making procedure--Feature engineerings--Heart arrhythmias--Knowledge tree--Learning models--Prior distribution--Neural networks;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85104197348

We aimed to build a mortality prediction model on a Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database and to assess whether the use of deep learning techniques like long short-term memory (LSTM) can effectively utilize the temporal relations among clinical variables. The models were built on clinical variable dynamics of the first 48 h of ICU admission of 12,550 records from the MIMIC-III database. A total of 36 variables including 33 time series variables and three static variables were used for the prediction. We present the application of LSTM and LSTM attention (LSTM-AT) model for mortality prediction with such a large number of clinical variables dataset. For training and validation purpose, we have used International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition (ICD-9) codes for extracting the patients with cardiovascular disease, and infections and parasitic disease, respectively. The effectiveness of the LSTM model is achieved over non-recurrent baseline models like naïve Bayes, logistic regression (LR), support vector machine and multilayer perceptron (MLP) by generating state of the art results (area under the curve [AUC], 0.852). Next, by providing attention at each time stamp, we developed a model, LSTM-AT, which exhibits even better performance (AUC, 0.876).  © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2019.;deep learning--LSTM--LSTM-AT--machine learning--MIMIC-III--mortality prediction;Bayes Theorem--Cardiovascular Diseases--Critical Care--Electronic Health Records--Humans--Intensive Care Units--Machine Learning--Neural Networks, Computer--Support Vector Machine--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Forecasting--Intensive care units--Large dataset--Learning systems--Support vector machines--Cardio-vascular disease--Comprehensive evaluation--Electronic health record--International classification of disease--LSTM--LSTM-AT--MIMIC-III--Multi layer perceptron--area under the curve--Article--Bayesian learning--cardiovascular disease--deep learning--feature selection--human--ICD-9--intensive care unit--logistic regression analysis--long short term memory network--mortality--multilayer perceptron--parasitosis--prediction--priority journal--recurrent neural network--support vector machine--systematic review--Bayes theorem--cardiovascular disease--electronic health record--intensive care--intensive care unit--machine learning--pathophysiology--Long short-term memory;De Gruyter;31846424;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85077749328

The prognosis of the onset of severe septic shock results in significant increases in mortality rate, length of stay and readmission rates. Continual advancements in health informatics data allows for applications within the machine learning field to predict sepsis onset in a timely manner, allowing for effective preventative intervention of severe septic shock. A novel deep learning application is proposed to provide effective prediction of sepsis onset by up to six hours prior, involving the use of novel concepts such as a boosted cascading training methodology and adjustable margin hinge loss function. The proposed methodology provides statistically significant improvements to that of current machine learning based modelling applications based off the Physionet Computing in Cardiology 2019 challenge.

Renewed interest in investigating the utility of SCG has been accelerated recently and benefited from new advances in low-cost lightweight sensors and machine learning methods. This article compares various machine learning algorithms (the method of nearest neighbors, the method of support vectors, decision trees, the ensemble of models) and neural networks: based on the architecture of long short-Term memory and convolutional ones. An original numerical experiment was carried out using the developed mathematical software, where all of the mentioned methods and algorithms were implemented. During this study, much attention was paid to the preparation and preliminary processing of data. In particular, signal filtering is carried out using the Butterworth filter, and the issues of extracting features from the signal, which will become an input vector for machine learning algorithms, are also discussed. To compare the effectiveness of the considered models for solving the problem of diagnosing diseases, Accuracy, Recall, Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision, F1-measure, etc. are given. For each algorithm and data set, confusion matrices and ROC curves were constructed. Results of this research show that convolutional neural networks are very effective at diagnosing the states of the human cardiovascular system and supporting decision-making in cardiology and cardiac surgery.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

The early prediction is important for the treatment of sepsis. This report aims to develop an early prediction method for sepsis 6 hours ahead on the basis of clinical electronic health records. Data Sources: Challenge data are released by PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019 and obtained from ICU patients in three separate hospital systems. Part of the data from two datasets, including 40,336 subjects, are publicly available, and the remaining are used as hidden test set. A normalized utility score defined by the organizing committee is used for model performance evaluation. Study Selection: The supervised machine learning is applied to tackle this challenge. Specifically, we establish the prediction model under the framework of ensemble learning by integrating the artificial features based on clinical prior knowledge of sepsis with deep features automatically extracted by long short-term memory neural network. Data Extraction: Forty clinical variables, including eight vital signs, 26 laboratory values, and six demographics, were measured and recorded once an hour for each individual, and the binary label (0 or 1) was simultaneously provided for each item. Data Synthesis: The proposed model was evaluated by 30-fold cross-validation. The sensitivity, specificity, and normalized utility score were 0.641 ± 0.022, 0.844 ± 0.007, and 0.401 ± 0.019 on publicly available datasets, respectively. The final normalized utility score our team (UCAS_DataMiner) has obtained was 0.313 on full hidden test set (0.406, 0.373, and-0.215 on test set A, B, and C, respectively). Conclusions: We realized a 6-hour ahead early-onset prediction of sepsis on the basis of clinical electronic health record by ensemble learning. The results indicated the proposed model functioned well in the early prediction of sepsis. In particular, ensemble learning had a significant (p < 0.01) improvement than any single model in performance.

Therefore, many researchers have attempted to automate that diagnostic procedure and some have developed wearable devices with a single ECG recording to detect CVD such as arrhythmia. A few have discussed feasible methods for wearable devices to increase the accuracy of diagnosing various CVDs, learning structural and morphological features in multiple ECG tracings but making a diagnosis solely with a single tracing. In this paper, we propose the Spark-trace Network (ST-Net) as a solution to the above issue. ST-Net encodes one of 12 real tracings to synthesize 11 new tracings that can capture the features of real ones. Then, ST-Net makes a diagnosis that relies on both real and synthetic tracings. ST-Net surpasses the baseline when classifying four types of CVDs and performs favorably when discriminating between myocardial infarction and normal rhythm, achieving 98.13% accuracy, 98.19% sensitivity, and 98.09% specificity on a five-fold test. Our network outperforms the state-of-the-art when diagnosing up to four types of CVDs on the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) dataset. Additionally, we demonstrated the inherent variance in ECG tracings between individuals by comparing the diagnostic results with the Class-oriented dataset and Subject-oriented dataset. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;Cardiovascular disease--Deep neural network--Electrocardiography--Signal synthesis;Cardiology--Diseases--Wearable technology--Cardiovascular disease--Clinical practices--Diagnostic procedure--Morphological features--Myocardial Infarction--Physikalisch-technische bundesanstalt--Subject-oriented--Wearable devices--Article--binary classification--cardiomyopathy--cardiovascular disease--controlled study--deep neural network--diagnostic accuracy--diagnostic test accuracy study--electrocardiography--heart arrhythmia--heart bundle branch block--heart failure--heart infarction--human--major clinical study--multiclass classification--priority journal--sensitivity and specificity--spark trace network--supervised machine learning--Electrocardiography;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85085842820

Machine learning is an artificial intelligence (AI) implementation that automatically learns and builds processes from experience. The leading cause of death worldwide at present is cardiovascular disease. The rate of death could be minimized by detecting the risk early. A lot of machine learning models have been developed to predict heart disease. We also introduced a fusion model to produce a better performance than the existing models. In this study, the proposed method analyzes two decision-making fusion models using five and ten-fold cross-validation to estimate the existence and absence of heart disease. The Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, and Keras were used as implementation tools. Three machine learning algorithms have been used here: The deep neural network (DNN), logistic regression(LR), and decision tree(DT). The decision tree and the logistic regression were merged separately with the deep neural network to form two fusion models (DNN+DT) and (DNN+LR), model-1 and mode-2. Five performance measurements have been used to compare model performance: Accuracy, recall accuracy, f1-score, and AUC score. A significant improvement was found in performance parameters after fusing the algorithms in this work. The fusion occurred at the decision level by adding the decision scores of two algorithms. The main target is to enhance the fused model's performance by combining the individual model's decision for better classification. For both model-1 and 2, the accuracy has increased. Model-2 has obtained 87.12% classification accuracy for 10-fold cross-validation, which is the highest accuracy. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

An early diagnosis of disease may control the death rate due to these diseases. In this paper, an efficient automated disease diagnosis model is designed using the machine learning models. In this paper, we have selected three critical diseases such as coronavirus, heart disease, and diabetes. In the proposed model, the data are entered into an android app, the analysis is then performed in a real-time database using a pretrained machine learning model which was trained on the same dataset and deployed in firebase, and finally, the disease detection result is shown in the android app. Logistic regression is used to carry out computation for prediction. Early detection can help in identifying the risk of coronavirus, heart disease, and diabetes. Comparative analysis indicates that the proposed model can help doctors to give timely medications for treatment.  © 2021 Naresh Kumar et al.;;Computer Simulation--COVID-19--Databases, Factual--Diabetes Mellitus--Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted--Early Diagnosis--Heart Diseases--Humans--Logistic Models--Machine Learning--Android (operating system)--Automation--Cardiology--Computer aided diagnosis--Disease control--E-learning--Logistic regression--Machine learning--insulin--Automated diagnosis--Comparative analysis--Disease detection--Disease diagnosis--Early diagnosis--Heart disease--Machine learning models--Real-time database--adult--alcohol consumption--Article--artificial intelligence--body height--body mass--body weight--coronavirus disease 2019--coughing--deep learning--diabetes mellitus--diastolic blood pressure--female--fever--heart disease--human--image segmentation--machine learning--male--middle aged--nonhuman--physical activity--skinfold thickness--smoking--systolic blood pressure--young adult--computer assisted diagnosis--computer simulation--diabetes mellitus--early diagnosis--factual database--heart disease--procedures--statistical model--Diseases;Hindawi Limited;34035886;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85106360667

Simultaneous improvements in computing power, data storage, and data analytics have led to the development of new techniques to address these challenges. One powerful tool to this end is machine learning (ML), which aims to algorithmically identify and represent structure within data. Machine learning’s ability to efficiently analyze large and highly complex data sets make it a desirable investigative approach in modern biomedical research. Despite this potential and enormous public and private sector investment, few prospective studies have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes from this technology. This is particularly true in cardiology, despite its emphasis on objective, data-driven results. This threatens to stifle ML’s growth and use in mainstream medicine. We outline the current state of ML in cardiology and outline methods through which impactful and sustainable ML research can occur. Following these steps can ensure ML reaches its potential as a transformative technology in medicine. © The Author(s) 2020.;artificial intelligence--cardiology--cardiovascular disease--deep learning--machine learning;Cardiology--Data Mining--Deep Learning--Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted--Diffusion of Innovation--Forecasting--Humans--Machine Learning--Therapy, Computer-Assisted--algorithm--artificial intelligence--cardiology--cardiovascular disease--clinical outcome--clinical practice--data analysis--deep learning--electrocardiogram--human--information storage--machine learning--medical research--medical technology--multidisciplinary team--nuclear magnetic resonance imaging--patient care--patient safety--priority journal--Review--cardiology--computer assisted diagnosis--computer assisted therapy--data mining--forecasting--machine learning--mass communication;SAGE Publications Ltd;32495652;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85085949607

Therefore, the attempt to clinically examine medical databases through conventional and leading-edge machine learning technologies is contemplated to be valuable, accurate and more importantly economical substitute for medical practitioners. In this research study, primarily we have exploited both individual learning algorithms and ensemble approaches including BayesNet, J48, KNN, multilayer perceptron, Naïve Bayes, random tree and random forest for prediction purposes. After analysing the performance of these classifiers, J48 attained noteworthy accuracy of 70.77% than other classifiers. We then employed new fangled techniques comprising TENSORFLOW, PYTORCH and KERAS on the same dataset acquired from Stanford online repository. The empirical results demonstrate that KERAS achieved an outstanding prediction accuracy of 80% in contrast to entire set of machine learning algorithms which were taken under investigation. Furthermore, based on the performance improvisation in prediction accuracy of cardiovascular disease, a novel prediction model was propounded after conducting performance analysis on both approaches (conventional and cutting-edge technologies). The principle objective behind this research study was the pursuit for fitting approaches that can lead to better prediction accuracy and reliability of diagnostic performance of cardiovascular disease. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;Classifiers--KERAS--Machine learning--Prediction--PYTORCH--TENSORFLOW;Cardiology--Cutting tools--Decision trees--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Forecasting--Learning systems--Medical computing--Multilayer neural networks--Predictive analytics--Risk assessment--Risk perception--Cardio-vascular disease--Conducting performance--Cutting edge technology--Diagnostic performance--Individual learning--Machine learning technology--Medical practitioner--Predictive modelling--Learning algorithms;Springer;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85089717880

Different ultrasound approaches are currently used to evaluate fetal cardiac structure and function, including conventional 2-D imaging and M-mode and tissue Doppler imaging among others. However, assessment of the fetal heart is still challenging mainly due to involuntary movements of the fetus, the small size of the heart, and the lack of expertise in fetal echocardiography of some sonographers. Therefore, the use of new technologies to improve the primary acquired images, to help extract measurements, or to aid in the diagnosis of cardiac abnormalities is of great importance for optimal assessment of the fetal heart. Machine leaning (ML) is a computer science discipline focused on teaching a computer to perform tasks with specific goals without explicitly programming the rules on how to perform this task. In this review we provide a brief overview on the potential of ML techniques to improve the evaluation of fetal cardiac function by optimizing image acquisition and quantification/segmentation, as well as aid in improving the prenatal diagnoses of fetal cardiac remodeling and abnormalities. © 2020 S.

Early detection and treatment of CVDs significantly contribute to the prevention or delay of cardiovascular death. Electrocardiogram (ECG) records the electrical impulses generated by heart muscles, which reflect regular or irregular beating activity. Computer-aided techniques provide fast and accurate tools to identify CVDs using a patient’s ECG signal, which have achieved great success in recent years. Latest computational diagnostic techniques based on ECG signals for estimating CVDs conditions are summarized here. The procedure of ECG signals analysis is discussed in several subsections, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, classification, and application. In particular, the End-to-End models integrate feature extraction and classification into learning algorithms, which not only greatly simplifies the process of data analysis, but also shows excellent accuracy and robustness. Portable devices enable users to monitor their cardiovascular status at any time, bringing new scenarios as well as challenges to the application of ECG algorithms. Computational diagnostic techniques for ECG signal analysis show great potential for helping health care professionals, and their application in daily life benefits both patients and sub-healthy people. © 2020 by the authors.

In this paper, we design domain-inspired neural network models to detect myocardial infarction. First, we study the contribution of various leads. This systematic analysis, first of its kind in the literature, indicates that out of 15 ECG leads, data from the v6, vz, and ii leads are critical to correctly identify myocardial infarction. Second, we use this finding and adapt the ConvNetQuake neural network model—originally designed to identify earthquakes—to attain state-of-the-art classification results for myocardial infarction, achieving 99.43% classification accuracy on a record-wise split, and 97.83% classification accuracy on a patient-wise split. These two results represent cardiologist-level performance level for myocardial infarction detection after feeding only 10 s of raw ECG data into our model. Third, we show that our multi-ECG-channel neural network achieves cardiologist-level performance without the need of any kind of manual feature extraction or data pre-processing. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Biomedical engineering--Machine learning--Signal processing;Biochemical engineering--Cardiology--Convolutional neural networks--Data handling--Electrocardiography--Classification accuracy--Classification results--Data preprocessing--Myocardial Infarction--Neural network model--Performance level--State of the art--Systematic analysis--Deep learning;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85097591377

Cardiovascular medicine with its large data repositories, need for operational efficiency and growing focus on precision care is set to be transformed by artificial intelligence. Applications range from new pathophysiologic discoveries to decision support for individual patient care to optimization of system-wide logistical processes. Recent findings Machine learning is the dominant form of artificial intelligence wherein complex statistical algorithms 'learn' by deducing patterns in datasets. Supervised machine learning uses classified large data to train an algorithm to accurately predict the outcome, whereas in unsupervised machine learning, the algorithm uncovers mathematical relationships within unclassified data. Artificial multilayered neural networks or deep learning is one of the most successful tools. Artificial intelligence has demonstrated superior efficacy in disease phenomapping, early warning systems, risk prediction, automated processing and interpretation of imaging, and increasing operational efficiency. Summary Artificial intelligence demonstrates the ability to learn through assimilation of large datasets to unravel complex relationships, discover prior unfound pathophysiological states and develop predictive models. Artificial intelligence needs widespread exploration and adoption for large-scale implementation in cardiovascular practice. Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Abdul Kalam Technical University, India--Brno University of Technology. Brno, Czech Republic;Background and objectives: Cardiovascular diseases are critical diseases and need to be diagnosed as early as possible. There is a lack of medical professionals in remote areas to diagnose these diseases. Artificial intelligence-based automatic diagnostic tools can help to diagnose cardiac diseases. This work presents an automatic classification method using machine learning to diagnose multiple cardiac diseases from phonocardiogram signals. Methods: The proposed system involves a convolutional neural network (CNN) model because of its high accuracy and robustness to automatically diagnose the cardiac disorders from the heart sounds. To improve the accuracy in a noisy environment and make the method robust, the proposed method has used data augmentation techniques for training and multi-classification of multiple cardiac diseases. Results: The model has been validated both heart sound data and augmented data using n-fold cross-validation. Results of all fold have been shown reported in this work.

Particularly in clinical oncology, fluorodeoxy glucose PET is usually applied in therapy monitoring, radiotherapy planning, staging, diagnosis, and follow-up. Adaptive radiation therapy assists in radiation treatment with the hope that specific therapies aimed at individual patients and target tumors can be developed to re-optimize the treatment plan as early as possible. The use of PET greatly benefits adaptive radiation therapy. Manual delineation is time-consuming and highly dependent on observers. Previous studies have shown that automatic computer-generated segmentations are more reproducible than manual delineations, especially for radiomic analysis. Therefore, automatic and accurate tumor delineation is highly demanded for subsequent determination of therapeutic options and achievement of an improved prognosis. Over the past decade, dozens of methods have been used, which rely on multiple image segmentation approaches or composed methods from broad categories, including thresholding, region-based, contour-based, and graph-based methods as well as clustering, statistical techniques, and machine learning. However, those methods depend on hand-crafted features and possess a limited capability to represent features. For medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated competitive performance. Nevertheless, these methods show the image classification based on region, in which the integral input image is split up and turns into small regions. Then, whether the small region belongs to the target (foreground) or not can be predicted by the CNN model of each small region. Therefore, each region merely stands for a partial area of the image--thus, this algorithm merely involves limited contextual knowledge that belongs to the small region. A U-Net, which is considered an optimal segmentation network for medical imaging, is trained end to end. It includes a contractive path and an expensive path produced by a combination of convolutional, up-sampling, and pooling layers. This architecture certified itself to be highly effective in using limited amounts of data for segmentation problems. Affected by recent achievements in deep learning, we exploit an automatic tumor segmentation method by deep convolutional U-Net with a pre-trained encoder. Method: In this paper, we present a fully automatic method for tumor segmentation by using a 14-layer U-Net model with two blocks of a VGG19 encoder pre-trained with ImageNet. The pre-trained VGG19 encoder contains 260 160 trainable parameters. The rest of our network consists of 14 layers with 1 605 961 trainable parameters. We fix the stride at 2. We propose three-step strategies to ensure effective and efficient learning with limited training data. First, we use the first two blocks of VGG19 as the contracting path and introduce rectified linear units (ReLUs) to each convolutional layer as the activation function. For the symmetrically expanding path, we arrange ReLUs and batch normalization after each convolutional layer. The loss of boundary pixels in each convolution layer necessitates cropping. For the last layer, we use a 1×1 convolution to map each 64-channel feature vector, and each component expresses the chance that the corresponding input pixel is within a target tumor. Second, a tumor holds a small portion within an entire PET image. Therefore, the pixel-wise classification tends to be biased to the outside of targets, leading to a high probability to partially segment or miss tumors. A loss function based on Jaccard distance is applied to eliminate the need for sample re-weighting, which is a typical procedure when using cross-entropy as the loss function for image segmentation due to a strong imbalance between the number of foreground and background pixels. Third, we import the DropBlock technique to replace the normal regularization dropout method because the former can help the U-Net efficiently avoid overfitting. This approach is a structured shape of dropout in which units in a successive region of a feature map are dropped together. In addition to the convolution layers, applying DropBlock in skip connections increases the accuracy. Result: A database that contains 1 309 PET images is applied to train and test the proposed segmentation model. We split the database into a before-radiotherapy (BR) sub-database and an after-radiotherapy (AR) sub-database. We use the mask, contour, and smoothed contour of a tumor, which are provided by an expert radiologist, as truths for teaching the proposed model. Experimental results on the BR sub-database show that our method presented a relatively high performance of tumor segmentation in PET images. The Dice coefficient (DI), Hausdorff distance, Jaccard index, sensitivity, and positive predicted value (PPV) are 0.862, 1.735, 0.769, 0.894, and 0.899, respectively. In the test stage, the total processing time of the testing dataset of the BR sub-database needs an average of 1.39 s, which can meet clinical real-time requirements. Then, we fine-tune the weights of the model that we have selected on the BR sub-database by training the network further with the AR sub-database. Experimental results indicate a good segmentation performance with a DI of 0.852, SE of 0.840, and PPV of 0.893. Compared with the traditional U-Net, our method increased by 5.9%, 15.1%, 1.9%, respectively. Finally, the volume of the segmented tumors in the PET images is presented, enabling the accurate automated identification and serial measurement of tumor volumes in PET images. Conclusion: This study uses a 14-layer U-Net architecture with a VGG19 pre-trained encoder for tumor segmentation in PET images. We demonstrate how to improve the performance of the U-Net by using a technique called fine-tuning in an encoder of network for initializing weights. Although fine-tuning has been widely applied in image classification tasks, it has not been applied to the like-U-Net-type architectures for medical image segmentation tasks. We use the Jaccard distance as the loss function to improve the segmentation performance. Overall results show that our approach is suitable for various tumors with minimum post-processing and without pre-processing. We believe that this method could be generalized effectively to other medical image segmentation tasks. © 2020, Editorial and Publishing Board of Journal of Image and Graphics.

The clinical assessment is based on typical symptoms and finally confirmed, invasively, by coronary angiography. Recently, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis as well as some machine learning algorithms like artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to identify cardiovascular arrhythmias and, only in few cases, to classify IHD segments in a limited number of subjects. The goal of this study was the identification of the ANN structure and the HRV parameters producing the best performance to identify IHD patients in a non-invasive way, validating the results on a large sample of subjects. Moreover, we examined the influence of a clinical non-invasive parameter, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), on the classification performance. Approach: To this aim, we extracted several linear and non-linear parameters from 24 h RR signal, considering both normal and ectopic beats (heart rate total variability), of 251 normal and 245 IHD subjects, matched by age and gender. ANNs using several different combinations of these parameters together with age and gender were tested. For each ANN, we varied the number of hidden neurons from 2 to 7 and simulated 100 times, changing randomly the training and test dataset. Main results: The HRTV parameters showed significant greater variability in IHD than in normal subjects. The ANN applied to mean RR, LF, LF/HF, beta exponent, SD2 together with age and gender reached a maximum accuracy of 71.8% and, by adding as input LVEF, an accuracy of 79.8%. Significance: The study provides a deep insight into how a combination of some HRTV parameters and LVEF could be exploited to reliably detect the presence of subjects affected by IHD. © 2020 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine;Artificial neural networks--Heart rate variability--Ischemic heart disease--Left ventricular ejection fraction--Non-linear analysis;Heart Rate--Humans--Machine Learning--Myocardial Ischemia--Stroke Volume--Ventricular Function, Left--Artificial heart--Cardiology--Diseases--Heart--Learning algorithms--Machine learning--Statistical tests--Cardiac death--Heart rate variability--Heart-rate--Ischemic heart disease--Left ventricular ejection fraction--Machine learning techniques--Myocardial Infarction--Non-linear analysis--Stable form--Total variabilities--heart left ventricle function--heart muscle ischemia--heart rate--heart stroke volume--human--machine learning--physiology--Neural networks;IOP Publishing Ltd;33080573;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85098656622

Nowadays, machine learning (ML, a subset of artificial intelligence) plays a vital role in numerous health-related domains, including the expansion of novel medical measures, managing patient information and records, and treatment of chronic ailments. ML in medicine has recently made headlines. Google has developed an ML technique to help recognize cancerous tumors on mammograms. Stanford uses a deep learning method to classify skin cancer diseases. Still, ML advances itself to developments better than other terminologies. Algorithms can deliver instant advantage to disciplines with procedures that are reproducible or consistent. Also, those with huge number of medical image datasets, such as radiology, pathology, and cardiology, are robust aspirants. ML can be qualified to look at images, classify irregularities, and opinion to parts that require attention, thus improving the correctness of all these developments. In future, ML will provide benefits to the family physician at home. ML can also offer an objective opinion to improve productivity, consistency, and accurateness. Healthcare needs to interchange from intelligence of ML as an innovative perception to sight it as a real-world tool that can be organized nowadays. We must take an incremental approach if ML has to play a role in healthcare system.

It does not give any symptoms at the early stage, and most patients are diagnosed during periods of CHD exacerbation. If CHD reaches a hard condition, it will require advanced and long-term treatments. Moreover, the early detection of CHD is not easy--doctors make a decision based on many kinds of clinical tests. In recent years, machine learning-based approaches are widely used in the healthcare domain to predict disease. In this study, we have proposed a deep neural network (DNN) model with an attention layer that gives importance weight to the input of the output layer for the CHD risk prediction model. The proposed method has been evaluated by predicting CHD risk in the Korean population and compared with typical machine learning algorithms. As a result, the proposed attention-based DNN improved the performance of DNN and outperformed regular machine learning classifiers. The performance measurements include accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and AUC score reached 82.7818%, 86.6499%, 77.2704%, 81.6631%, and 82.5802%, respectively. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.;Attention layer--Coronary heart disease--Deep neural network;Cardiology--Deep learning--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Forecasting--Heart--Learning systems--Multilayer neural networks--Multimedia signal processing--Predictive analytics--Clinical tests--Coronary heart disease--Decision-based--Healthcare domains--Importance weights--Output layer--Performance measurements--Risk prediction models--Learning algorithms;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85105955574

Electrocardiography (ECG) is the most common tool used to identify a pathology in the cardiac electrical conduction system. ECG analysis is usually manually performed by an expert physician. However, manual interpretation is time-consuming and challenging even for cardiologists. Many automatic algorithms relying on handcrafted features and traditional machine learning classifiers were developed to recognize cardiac diseases. However, a large a priori knowledge about ECG signals is exploited. To overcome this main limitation and provide higher performance, recently, deep neural networks were designed and applied for 12-lead ECG classification. In this study, we designed decoding workflows based on three state-of-the-art architectures for time series classification. These were InceptionTime, ResNet and XResNet. Experiments were conducted using the training datasets provided during the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020. The best-performing algorithm was based on InceptionTime, scoring a training 5-fold cross-validation challenge metric of 0.5183±0.0016, while using a low number of parameters (510491 in total). Thus, this algorithm provided the best compromise between performance and complexity. © 2020 Creative Commons--the authors hold their copyright.;;Cardiology--Convolutional neural networks--Deep neural networks--Electrocardiography--Machine learning--Automatic algorithms--Cardiac arrhythmia--Ecg classifications--Electrical conduction--Multi label classification--Multiple centers--Time series classifications--Training data sets--Classification (of information);IEEE Computer Society;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85100925582

Cardiac imaging-genetics aims to identify and characterize the genetic variants that influence functional, physiological, and anatomical phenotypes derived from cardiovascular imaging. High-throughput DNA sequencing and genotyping have greatly accelerated genetic discovery, making variant interpretation one of the key challenges in contemporary clinical genetics. Heterogeneous, low-fidelity phenotyping and difficulties integrating and then analyzing large-scale genetic, imaging and clinical datasets using traditional statistical approaches have impeded process. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods, such as deep learning, are particularly suited to tackle the challenges of scalability and high dimensionality of data and show promise in the field of cardiac imaging-genetics. Here we review the current state of AI as applied to imaging-genetics research and discuss outstanding methodological challenges, as the field moves from pilot studies to mainstream applications, from one dimensional global descriptors to high-resolution models of whole-organ shape and function, from univariate to multivariate analysis and from candidate gene to genome-wide approaches. Finally, we consider the future directions and prospects of AI imaging-genetics for ultimately helping understand the genetic and environmental underpinnings of cardiovascular health and disease. © Copyright © 2020 de Marvao, Dawes and O'Regan.;artificial intelligence--cardiology--cardiovascular imaging--deep learning--genetics--genomics--imaging-genetics--machine learning;artificial intelligence--cardiac imaging--computer graphics--computer prediction--convolutional neural network--coronary angiography--DNA sequence--echocardiography--genetics--genome-wide association study--heredity--high throughput imaging--hospital readmission--image processing--interrater reliability--learning algorithm--machine learning--phenotype--prediction--Review--sensitivity and specificity--support vector machine--thorax radiography--three-dimensional imaging--training--validation process;Frontiers Media S.A.;;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85079422800

With the availability of machine learning tools coupled with vast data sources, the management of atrial fibrillation (AF), a common chronic disease with significant associated morbidity and socioeconomic impact, is undergoing a knowledge and practice transformation in the increasingly complex healthcare environment. Among other advances, deep-learning machine learning methods, including convolutional neural networks, have enabled the development of AF screening pathways using the ubiquitous 12-lead ECG to detect asymptomatic paroxysmal AF in at-risk populations (such as those with cryptogenic stroke), the refinement of AF and stroke prediction schemes through comprehensive digital phenotyping using structured and unstructured data abstraction from the electronic health record or wearable monitoring technologies, and the optimization of treatment strategies, ranging from stroke prophylaxis to monitoring of antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy. Although the clinical and population-wide impact of these tools continues to be elucidated, such transformative progress does not come without challenges, such as the concerns about adopting black box technologies, assessing input data quality for training such models, and the risk of perpetuating rather than alleviating health disparities. This review critically appraises the advances of machine learning related to the care of AF thus far, their potential future directions, and its potential limitations and challenges. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

For MI patients, specifying the exact location of a heart muscle suffering from blood shortage or stoppage is of crucial importance. Automatic localization systems can support physicians for better decisions in emergency situations. Using 12-lead electrocardiogram, in this paper, two MI detection and localization methods are proposed with classic and end-to-end deep machine learning techniques. For the feature extraction phase, the classic approach performs a Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the pre-processed signals followed by a shallow neural network (NN) for the classification phase. However, in the end-to-end residual deep learning technique, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is directly employed on the pre-processed input signals. For specifying the infarcted region of myocardium, 6 classes of subdiagnosis are considered. Proposed models are verified with the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) dataset, where the data of each patient is first grouped and then carefully partitioned to training, validation, and test datasets. The results of K-fold cross-validation indicate that the general model achieves over 98% accuracy for both MI detection and localization with fewer number of feature sets compared to previous studies. Moreover, the end-to-end CNN model shows superior performance by achieving perfect results. Thus, with the larger size of CNN models, one may choose a perfect system that requires larger memory compared to another system that requires less computational power and accepts nearly 2% of false positives and/or false negatives. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.;Artificial neural networks--Deep residual learning--Discrete wavelet transform--ECG signal processing--Myocardial infarction--Principal Component Analysis;Cardiology--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Discrete wavelet transforms--Feature extraction--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Principal component analysis--Statistical tests--Automatic localization--Detection and localization--Emergency situation--K fold cross validations--Machine learning techniques--Myocardial Infarction--Myocardial ischemia--Physikalisch-technische bundesanstalt--Deep neural networks;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85085088141

This goal can be achieved using an optimal machine learning model with rich healthcare data on heart diseases. Various systems based on machine learning have been presented recently to predict and diagnose heart disease. However, these systems cannot handle high-dimensional datasets due to the lack of a smart framework that can use different sources of data for heart disease prediction. In addition, the existing systems utilize conventional techniques to select features from a dataset and compute a general weight for them based on their significance. These methods have also failed to enhance the performance of heart disease diagnosis. In this paper, a smart healthcare system is proposed for heart disease prediction using ensemble deep learning and feature fusion approaches. First, the feature fusion method combines the extracted features from both sensor data and electronic medical records to generate valuable healthcare data. Second, the information gain technique eliminates irrelevant and redundant features, and selects the important ones, which decreases the computational burden and enhances the system performance. In addition, the conditional probability approach computes a specific feature weight for each class, which further improves system performance. Finally, the ensemble deep learning model is trained for heart disease prediction. The proposed system is evaluated with heart disease data and compared with traditional classifiers based on feature fusion, feature selection, and weighting techniques. The proposed system obtains accuracy of 98.5%, which is higher than existing systems. This result shows that our system is more effective for the prediction of heart disease, in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods. © 2020;Deep learning--Feature extraction--Feature fusion--Heart disease prediction--Ontology;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Feature extraction--Forecasting--Health care--Heart--Medical computing--Sensor data fusion--Conditional probabilities--Conventional techniques--Electronic medical record--Heart disease diagnosis--High dimensional datasets--Prediction of heart disease--Smart healthcare systems--State-of-the-art methods--Learning systems;Elsevier B.V.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85087655069

In this paper classifiers comparative study has been performed for the tumor and heart disease classification. Around one lac women are diagnosed annually with this life-threatening disease having no family history of the disease. If it is not treated on time it may grow and spread to the other parts of human body. Mammograms are the X-rays of the breast which can be used for the screening of cancer tumor. Prior identification of breast cancer may increase the chance of survival up to 70 percent. Tumors which causes cancer can be categorized into two types: a) Benign and b) Malignant. Benign tumor can be explained as the tumor which are not attached to neighbor tissues or spread in the other parts of the body. In Malignant tumor, other parts may be affected by it as it can grow and spread in the other parts of the body. To classify the tumor as Malignant or Benign is very complex as the similarities of cancer tumor and tumor caused by the skin inflammation are almost same. The early identification of Malignant is mandatory to protect the patient life. Diversified medical methods based on deep learning and machine learning have been developed to treat the patients as cancer is a very serious and crucial issue in this era. In this research paper machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, K-NN and tree have been applied to the breast cancer data set which has been taken from UCI Machine learning repository. Comparative study of classifiers has been performed to determine the better classifier for the robust prediction of breast tumors. Simulated results proved that using Logistic regression, ninety-one percent accuracy was achieved. The research showed that logistic regression can be applied for the accurate and precise early prediction of breast cancer. Cardiovascular disease is very common throughout the world. It has been noticed that health in cardiac patients that there are so many factors which causes heart disease or heart attack. The factors leading to the heart failure includes varying blood pressure, high sugar, cardiac pain, and heart rate, high cholesterol level (LDL), artery blockage and irregular ECG signals. Many researchers proved that stress in patients can also be the reason for the heart disease. Higher numbers of cardiac surgeries like angioplasty and heart by-pass are performed on annual basis. Actually, people don't care about their lifestyle and diet and fully ignore the symbols. It can be early predicted and cured if proper testing and medication for heart is done. Sometimes there is a false pain which has the same feeling like angina pain depicting cardiovascular disease. To reduce the false alarm and robustly classify the heart disease, several machine learning approaches have been adopted. In proposed research for the accurate classification of heart disease comparison has been performed among support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors K-NN and linear discriminant analysis. Simulated results demonstrated that Support vector machine was found to be a better classifier having an accuracy of 80.4%. © 2020.

Meanwhile, unprecedented advances in computational infrastructure and analysis algorithms are realizing image-based digital diagnosis not only in radiology and cardiology but also oncology and other diseases. Machine learning methods, especially deep learning techniques, are already and broadly implemented in diverse technological and industrial sectors, but their applications in healthcare are just starting. Uniquely in biomedical research, a vast potential exists to integrate genomics data with histopathological imaging data. The integration has the potential to extend the pathologist’s limits and boundaries, which may create breakthroughs in diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring at molecular and tissue levels. Moreover, the applications of genomics data are realizing the potential for personalized medicine, making diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and prognosis more accurate. In this chapter, we discuss machine learning methods readily available for digital pathology applications, new prospects of integrating spatial genomics data on tissues with tissue morphology, and frontier approaches to combining genomics data with pathological imaging data.

In this paper, a machine learning algorithm is proposed for predicting CHF using convolutional neural network (CNN). The system uses a VGG16 model, which is dependent on ImageNet and utilizes ECG signal. The CHF information is obtained from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre (BIDMC) CHF dataset and also the typical dataset from the FANTASIA database. Various models of CNN were prepared and tested on the dataset to obtain the information about CHF or normal for a patient until the required accuracy is achieved. The performance is assessed based on the accuracy of the code and precision. The ECG signal of a patient recorded for 24 hours is utilized in this research.

However, there are some situations where the clusters fail to maintain their performance due to mixed datasets problems. An active research area that is severely affected by these problems is the heart disease dataset. Deep learning methods, the state-of-the-art classifiers, with better learning procedures and computational resources, can fill these gaps. To improve the robustness of clusters, we propose a Constraint-Based Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (CB-DCGANs) framework for generating simulated data to augment the training set to improve the performance of the clustering algorithm. We evaluated the performance of Discriminatively Boosted Clustering (DBC) in detecting the clusters from given datasets.

In general, diagnosing in the early stage is usually performed using routine auscultation examination using a stethoscope which requires human interpretation. Recording of heart sounds using an electronic microphone embedded inside the stethoscope provides a digital recording which is known as a phonocardiogram (PCG). This PCG signal carries very informative data about the status of the heart and its valves. Recently, several machines and deep learning techniques employed signal processing to classify heart disorders using PCG. Based on the used datasets, heart sound can be exploited to classify five types of heart sounds, one is normal, and the others are abnormal and two classes of heart sound, normal and abnormal. This research used a modified version of previously proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) which is AOCTNet architecture for automatic diagnosis of heart valves conditions based on higher order spectral estimation using bispectrum of heart sounds recordings. The results show that the proposed system has a comparable performance comparing to other methods. The methodology proposed in this paper can detect heart valves disorders using PCG signals with an overall accuracy of 98.70 and 97.10% using full bispectrum images and contour bispectrum images, respectively, for five classes dataset and overall accuracy of 99.47 and 98.74% using full bispectrum images and contour bispectrum images, respectively, for two classes dataset. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.;Bispectrum--Classification--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--PCG;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Image classification--Learning systems--Phonocardiography--Spectrum analysis--Analysis approach--Bispectra--Bispectrum analysis--Classification of heart sounds--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Heart sounds--Heart valves--Overall accuracies--Phonocardiograms--accuracy--aortic stenosis--Article--artificial neural network--auscultation--convolutional neural network--deep learning--electroencephalography--Fourier transform--frequency--heart sound--human--image analysis--learning algorithm--machine learning--mathematical model--mitral valve prolapse--mitral valve regurgitation--mitral valve stenosis--phonocardiography--priority journal--sensitivity and specificity--signal processing--sound--systolic heart murmur--training--two-dimensional imaging--waveform--Heart;Springer;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85092328424

The proposed framework addresses two tasks. The first task is automatic detection of myocardial contours, the infarcted area, the no-reflow area, and the left ventricular cavity from a short-axis DE-MRI series. It employs two segmentation neural networks. The first network is used to segment the anatomical structures such as the myocardium and left ventricular cavity. The second network is used to segment the pathological areas such as myocardial infarction, myocardial no-reflow, and normal myocardial region. The segmented myocardium region from the first network is further used to refine the second network’s pathological segmentation results. The second task is to automatically classify a given case into normal or pathological from clinical information with or without DE-MRI. A cascaded support vector machine (SVM) is employed to classify a given case from its associated clinical information. The segmented pathological areas from DE-MRI are also used for the classification task. We evaluated our method on the 2020 EMIDEC MICCAI challenge dataset. It yielded an average Dice index of 0.93 and 0.84, respectively, for the left ventricular cavity and the myocardium. The classification from using only clinical information yielded 80% accuracy over five-fold cross-validation. Using the DE-MRI, our method can classify the cases with 93.3% accuracy. These experimental results reveal that the proposed method can automatically evaluate the myocardial infarction. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Cardiac MRI segmentation--Classification--Clinical information--CNNs--Myocardial infarction--Myocardial no-reflow;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Computation theory--Computational methods--Deep learning--Support vector machines--Anatomical structures--Automatic Detection--Classification tasks--Clinical information--Convolutional networks--Learning frameworks--Myocardial Infarction--Segmentation results--Convolutional neural networks;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85101569539

Motivated by the great efficiency and popularity of deep learning algorithms for time series classification, the proposed work is mainly based on the One Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN). Unlike the traditional CNN models based classification, a new Multi-Level Wavelet Convolutional Neural Networks (ML-WCNN) is proposed to recognize automatically various types of cardiac arrhythmias. The proposed approach incorporates the 1D-CNN model and the Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) to extract discriminative features from different wavelet sub-bands and from the raw ECG signal simultaneously. The extracted features by the ML-WCNN model are then merged using different fusion strategies, especially by concatenation and maximization. This improves greatly the features learning process at different scales of the ECG signal, providing better diagnosis performances.

The pulse signal of patients with cardiovascular disease is quite different from that of normal people. In pulse classification, traditional methods generally need to manually extract feature information of the time domain and frequency domain, and then perform pulse classification through machine learning methods such as KNN and SVM. However, the manually extracted features may not really represent the true features of the signal. Convolutional neural network (CNN) can automatically extract local features through different convolution kernels, and it can extract the original features of the signal very well. This paper designs a one-dimensional convolution (1D-CNN) residual neural network structure to identify the pulse signal. First, the original data is sliced and normalized, and then the data set is divided into training set and test set, Then take the processed pulse signal directly as input. This allows the computer to perform feature self-learning through the network structure, Finally, it is classified through the fully connected layer. The final classification accuracy rate can reach 97.14 %, which is better than traditional machine learning classification methods such as SVM and KNN, It provides new ideas and methods for the classification and objectification of pulse signals. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;1D-CNN--Deep learning--Pulse recognition--Residual network structure;Biomimetics--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Computation theory--Computer aided diagnosis--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Diseases--Frequency domain analysis--Learning systems--One dimensional--Statistical tests--Support vector machines--Time domain analysis--Cardio-vascular disease--Classification accuracy--Clinical diagnosis--Feature information--Machine learning classification--Machine learning methods--Neural network structures--Traditional Chinese Medicine--Biomedical signal processing;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85107518857

Nevertheless, despite the high mortality rate and associated costs, it can be managed. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, and internet of things offer advantages for the management of HF. Using the medical records of HF patients, five machine learning algorithms - deep learning (DL), generalized linear models (GLM), naïve base (NB), random forest (RF), and support vector machines(SVM) were used to build classifiers to predict HF. The results indicate that machine learning algorithms are effective tools for classifying the medical records of HF patients.

The early detection of heart abnormalities plays an important role in reducing the mortality rate caused by heart diseases. Auscultation, the process of listening to heart sounds, is the first diagnostic method of heart diseases. This process is highly dependent on the physician expertise, making the diagnosis more of a subjective issue. There is ongoing research to automate heart sound diagnosis. Advances in machine learning have provided an easier, cheaper and objective diagnosis of diseases. Algorithms developed for heart sound classifications rely on several features and the accuracy of a model depends on the feature vector. The advent of deep learning (DL) provides a possible solution to overcome the overwhelming and time-consuming step of feature extraction. Convolutional neural networks (CNN), popular deep network architectures, offer high classification accuracies for 2D images and 1D time series. This study proposes an efficient and highly accurate method for heart sound signal classification. The continuous wavelet transform method is employed to obtain scalogram images. The 2D scalogram images are fed to a deep CNN classifier. Using the heart sound dataset consisting of 4 abnormal and 1 normal heart sound subsets, this study investigates both binary classification and multi-class classification. The proposed classification method outperformed the state-of-the-art methods in the literature.  © 2020 IEEE.;Continuous wavelet transform--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Scalogram;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Computer aided diagnosis--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Diseases--Heart--Learning systems--Network architecture--Wavelet analysis--Wavelet transforms--Binary classification--Cardio-vascular disease--Classification accuracy--Classification methods--Classification of heart sounds--Continuous Wavelet Transform--Multi-class classification--State-of-the-art methods--Biomedical signal processing;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85100315724

Digital health and AI applications in medicine and biology are emerging worldwide, not only in resource-rich but also resource-limited regions. AI predates to the mid-20th century, but the current wave of AI builds in part on machine learning (ML), big data, and algorithms that can learn from massive amounts of online user data from patients or healthy persons. There are lessons to be learned from AI applications in different medical specialties and across developed and resource-limited contexts. A case in point is congenital heart defects (CHDs) that continue to plague sub-Saharan Africa, which calls for innovative approaches to improve risk prediction and performance of the available diagnostics. Beyond CHDs, AI in cardiology is a promising context as well. The current suite of digital health applications in CHD and cardiology include complementary technologies such as neural networks, ML, natural language processing and deep learning, not to mention embedded digital sensors. Algorithms that build on these advances are beginning to complement traditional medical expertise while inviting us to redefine the concepts and definitions of expertise in molecular diagnostics and precision medicine. We examine and share here the lessons learned in current attempts to implement AI and digital health in CHD for precision risk prediction and diagnosis in resource-limited settings. These top 10 lessons on AI and digital health summarized in this expert review are relevant broadly beyond CHD in cardiology and medical innovations. As with AI itself that calls for systems approaches to data capture, analysis, and interpretation, both developed and developing countries can usefully learn from their respective experiences as digital health continues to evolve worldwide. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.;Artificial intelligence--Congenital heart defects--Deep learning--Digital health--EHealth--Machine learning;Algorithms--Artificial Intelligence--Cardiology--Heart Defects, Congenital--Humans--Machine Learning--Neural Networks, Computer--Precision Medicine--Africa south of the Sahara--Article--artificial intelligence--artificial neural network--bioinformatics--cardiac imaging--congenital heart malformation--deep learning--developing country--disease classification--genomics--health care policy--human--machine learning--molecular fingerprinting--natural language processing--personalized medicine--priority journal--proteomics--signal detection--telecardiology--telehealth--algorithm--artificial intelligence--cardiology--congenital heart malformation--procedures;Mary Ann Liebert Inc.;31592719;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85078330919

Automatic AF detection methods have been studied in previous works. However, a model cannot be used all the time without any improvement. And updating model requires adequate data and cost. Therefore, this study aims at finding a low-cost way to choose learning samples and developing an incremental learning system for AF detection. Methods: Based on transfer learning and active learning, this paper proposed a loop-locked framework integrating AF diagnose, label query, and model fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, a novel multiple-input deep neural network (MIDNN) is pre-trained using labeled samples from an original training set. In practical application, the model can be used for AF detection. Meanwhile, continuous data is collected to form the candidate set. In the incremental learning stage, the model was fine-tuned continuously by the most informative samples in the candidate set. These samples are selected from the candidate set based on the pre-trained model and a new active learning strategy. The strategy combines the features and the uncertainty of the predicted results. Results: In order to evaluate the method, the MIT-BIH atrial fibrillation database was used for pre-training and samples of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database were taken as candidate set. The initial values of Acc, Sen, and PPV were 87.40%, 97.46%, and 81.11%. These indexes reached to the top values of 97.53%, 100.00%, and 95.29% after 14 iterations. Hence, the number of queries was saved by 90.67%. Conclusions: The proposed system is able to update the model continuously and reduce the labeling cost over 90%. The comparisons demonstrated the effectiveness of MIDNN model and the suitability of novel learning strategy for AF. Moreover, this framework can be extended to other biomedical applications. © 2019;Active learning--Atrial fibrillation--Deep neural network--Electrocardiogram (ECG)--Transfer learning;Algorithms--Atrial Fibrillation--Cardiology--Databases, Factual--Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted--Electrocardiography--Humans--Machine Learning--Neural Networks, Computer--Problem-Based Learning--Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted--Software--Artificial intelligence--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Medical applications--Query processing--Active Learning--Active learning strategies--Atrial fibrillation--Biomedical applications--Detection methods--Incremental learning--Learning strategy--Transfer learning--active learning--Article--atrial fibrillation--controlled study--convolutional neural network--data base--detection algorithm--diagnostic accuracy--health care cost--human--incremental learning--learning--learning algorithm--long short term memory network--predictive value--sensitivity and specificity--transfer of learning--algorithm--atrial fibrillation--cardiology--computer assisted diagnosis--diagnostic imaging--electrocardiography--factual database--machine learning--problem based learning--signal processing--software--Deep neural networks;Elsevier Ireland Ltd;31786450;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85075581200

Early diagnosis and treatment of MI are crucial to prevent further heart tissue damages or death. The earliest and most reliable sign of ischemia is regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA) of the affected part of the ventricular muscle. Echocardiography can easily, inexpensively, and non-invasively exhibit the RWMA. In this article, we introduce a three-phase approach for early MI detection in low-quality echocardiography: 1) segmentation of the entire left ventricle (LV) wall using a state-of-the-art deep learning model, 2) analysis of the segmented LV wall by feature engineering, and 3) early MI detection. The main contributions of this study are highly accurate segmentation of the LV wall from low-quality echocardiography, pseudo labeling approach for ground-truth formation of the unannotated LV wall, and the first public echocardiographic dataset (HMC-QU)a MI detection. Furthermore, the outputs of the proposed approach can significantly help cardiologists for a better assessment of the LV wall characteristics. The proposed approach has achieved 95.72% sensitivity and 99.58% specificity for the LV wall segmentation, and 85.97% sensitivity, 74.03% specificity, and 86.85% precision for MI detection on the HMC-QU dataset.aThe benchmark HMC-QU dataset is publicly shared at the repository https://www.kaggle.com/aysendegerli/hmcqu-dataset.for  © 2013 IEEE.;Deep learning--echocardiography--machine learning--myocardial infarction;Artificial life--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Early diagnosis--Feature engineerings--Highly accurate--Learning models--Left ventricles--Low qualities--Myocardial Infarction--State of the art--Echocardiography;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85100930652

Over 50 million persons have cardiovascular diseases around the world. Our proposed work based on 744 segments of ECG signal is obtained from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database (strongly imbalanced data) for one lead (modified lead II), from 29 people. In this work, we have used long-duration (10 s) ECG signal segments (13 times less classifications/analysis). The spectral power density was estimated based on Welch’s method and discrete Fourier transform to strengthen the characteristic ECG signal features. Our main contribution is the design of a novel three-layer (48 + 4 + 1) deep genetic ensemble of classifiers (DGEC). Developed method is a hybrid which combines the advantages of: (1) ensemble learning, (2) deep learning, and (3) evolutionary computation. Novel system was developed by the fusion of three normalization types, four Hamming window widths, four classifiers types, stratified tenfold cross-validation, genetic feature (frequency components) selection, layered learning, genetic optimization of classifiers parameters, and new genetic layered training (expert votes selection) to connect classifiers. The developed DGEC system achieved a recognition sensitivity of 94.62% (40 errors/744 classifications), accuracy = 99.37%, specificity = 99.66% with classification time of single sample = 0.8736 (s) in detecting 17 arrhythmia ECG classes.

The analysis and interpretation of ECHO are dependent on the doctor's experience. However, software that uses artificial intelligence to analyze ECHO images or videos is contributing to support the physician's decision. This paper aims to perform a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques applied in the automation of Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) processes, to support medical decisions. The study identified more than 800 articles on the topic in the leading scientific research platforms. To select the most relevant studies, inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, where 45 articles were selected to compose the detailed study of the SRL. The results obtained with the extraction of information from the papers, identified 3 groups of primary studies, namely: identification of the cardiac vision plan, analysis of cardiac functions and detection of cardiac diseases. SRL identifies that the set of Machine learning (ML) techniques are being widely applied in the tasks of segmentation, detection and classification of images obtained from ECHO. The techniques based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), presented the best Accuracy rates. Research shows a strong interest in automating ECHO processes. However, it is still an open research field, with the potential to generate many publications for researchers. © 2020 IEEE.;Deep Learning--Echocardiogram--Ecocardiography--Machine Learning--Systematic Review;Application programs--Cardiology--Convolutional neural networks--Image segmentation--Machine learning--Ultrasonic applications--Cardiac functions--Extraction of information--Inclusion and exclusions--Medical decision making--Research fields--Scientific researches--Systematic literature review (SLR)--Systematic Review--Heart;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85094171015

We investigated on a hybrid approach, combining average-template-based algorithms with deep neural networks (DNNs), to build an ensemble classification model. We calibrated the model on the available 40,000+ ECGs, while organizers tested the model on a private test set. Standard ECG preprocessing was applied. For ECGs related to CAs altering the ECG morphology, multi-lead average P, QRS, and T segments were computed. For signals associated with irregular rhythms, time dependent features were computed. The ensemble model comprised of: i) three DNNs to classify morphology-related CAs. ii) a fully connected neural network to classify irregular rhythm--and iii) a threshold-based classifier for premature ventricular beat detection. The organizers designed a score for ranking the models. The ensemble model proposed by our team 'BiSP Lab' reached the 40th position, and obtained a score of -0.179 on the private test set. Despite the low performance obtained on the private test set, our ensemble model showed potential for classification of CAs from ECGs. © 2020 Creative Commons--the authors hold their copyright.;;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Deep learning--Deep neural networks--Electrocardiography--Learning to rank--Morphology--Neural networks--Automatic classification--ECG preprocessing--Ensemble classification--Ensemble modeling--Fully connected neural network--Machine learning approaches--Premature ventricular beats--Threshold-based classifiers--Biomedical signal processing;IEEE Computer Society;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85100925915

Recently, few studies examined the length of stay (LOS) predictive analytics for cardiovascular inpatients in ICU. However, there are almost scarcely real attempts utilized machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart failure patients length of stay in ICU hospitalization. This paper introduces a predictive research architecture to predict Length of Stay (LOS) for heart failure diagnoses from electronic medical records using the state-of-art- machine learning models, in particular, the ensembles regressors and deep learning regression models. Our results showed that the gradient boosting regressor (GBR) outweighed the other proposed models in this study. The GBR reported higher R-squared value followed by the proposed method in this study called Staking Regressor. Additionally, The Random forest Regressor (RFR) was the fastest model to train. Our outcomes suggested that deep learning-based regressor did not achieve better results than the traditional regression model in this study.

Both machine learning and deep learning AI applications have recently begun to impact cardiovascular medicine. Scientists working in the AI domain have long recognized the importance of data quality and provenance to AI algorithm efficiency and accuracy. A diverse array of cardiovascular raw data sources of variable quality - electronic medical records, radiological picture archiving and communication systems, laboratory results, omics, etc. - are available to train AI algorithms for predictive modeling of clinical outcomes (in-hospital mortality, acute coronary syndrome risk stratification, etc.), accelerated image interpretation (edge detection, tissue characterization, etc.) and enhanced phenotyping of heterogeneous conditions (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, hypertension, etc.). A number of software as medical device narrow AI products for cardiac arrhythmia characterization and advanced image deconvolution are now Food and Drug Administration approved, and many others are in the pipeline. Present and future health professionals using AI-infused analytics and wearable devices have 3 critical roles to play in their informed development and ethical application in practice: (1) medical domain experts providing clinical context to computer and data scientists, (2) data stewards assuring the quality, relevance and provenance of data inputs, and (3) real-time and post-hoc interpreters of AI black box solutions and recommendations to patients. The next wave of so-called contextual adaption AI technologies will more closely approximate human decision-making, potentially augmenting cardiologists' real-time performance in emergency rooms, catheterization laboratories, imaging suites, and clinics. However, before such higher order AI technologies are adopted in the clinical setting and by healthcare systems, regulatory agencies, and industry must jointly develop robust AI standards of practice and transparent technology insertion rule sets. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Over 100,000 people each year in the UK suffer from an MI according to the report by British Heart Foundation. Following an MI, there is irreversible heart muscle damage that will become scar. The amount of scar following larger heart attacks, ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, drives enlargement of the heart and is associated with worse prognosis (increased risk of death and subsequent heart failure). Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) has become the 'gold standard' for the visualization of MI. However, to date, no 'gold standard' fully automated methods exist for the quantification of MI from MRI.In this work, we propose an approach to construct such methods using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies, in particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Uncertainties, variability, and a possibility of bias inherent to any data imply that data-driven systems which are intended for use in clinical research and practice must be capable of learning from mistakes on-the-job. Here we develop and test a first deep learning CNN system with error correction capabilities (CNNEC) for the detection and quantification of MI. The system could be viewed as a proof-of-principle for the technology. © 2020 IEEE.;Automatic detection--Convolution neural network--Error correction--Myocardial infarction;Cardiology--Clinical research--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--Digital storage--Error correction--Error detection--Heart--Magnetic resonance imaging--Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging--Convolution neural network--Detection and quantifications--Error correction capability--Fully automated--Myocardial Infarction--Proof of principles--St-segment elevations--Learning systems;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85093870957

Background: Recent efforts in collecting multiomics data open numerous opportunities for comprehensive integration of highly heterogenous data to classify a patient's cardiovascular state, eventually leading to tailored therapies. Methods: A total of 42 echocardiography features, including 2-dimensional and Doppler measurements, left ventricular (LV) and atrial speckle-tracking, and vector flow mapping data, were obtained in 297 patients. A similarity network was developed to delineate distinct patient phenotypes, and then neural network models were trained for discriminating the phenotypic presentations. Results: The patient similarity model identified 4 clusters (I to IV), with patients in each cluster showed distinctive clinical presentations based on American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association heart failure stage and the occurrence of short-term major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. Compared with other clusters, cluster IV had a higher prevalence of stage C or D heart failure (78%--p < 0.001), New York Heart Association functional classes III or IV (61%--p < 0.001), and a higher incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (p < 0.001). The neural network model showed robust prediction of patient clusters, with area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve ranging from 0.82 to 0.99 for the independent hold-out validation set. Conclusions: Automated computational methods for phenotyping can be an effective strategy to fuse multidimensional parameters of LV structure and function. It can identify distinct cardiac phenogroups in terms of clinical characteristics, cardiac structure and function, hemodynamics, and outcomes. © 2020 American College of Cardiology Foundation;deep phenotype--heart failure--high-dimensional echocardiographic parameters--topological data analysis;Cardiac Imaging Techniques--Echocardiography--Heart Failure--Heart Ventricles--Humans--Predictive Value of Tests--Ventricular Function, Left--adult--Article--artificial neural network--cardiac imaging--clinical outcome--controlled study--Doppler echocardiography--echocardiography--female--follow up--heart failure--heart left ventricle--human--machine learning--major clinical study--male--New York Heart Association class--phenomics--phenotype--prevalence--priority journal--prospective study--QRS complex--speckle tracking echocardiography--supervised machine learning--cardiac imaging--diagnostic imaging--heart failure--heart left ventricle function--heart ventricle--predictive value;Elsevier Inc.;32762883;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85088377795

Sensors attached to the skin are used to detect the electrical signal produced by one's heart each time it beats. Many people around the world suffer from cardiovascular diseases. So it is important to detect arrhythmia/abnormal and normal ECG signal more accurately. In this paper, ECG signal is classified by support vector machine (SVM) and neural network. The research is conducted on the normal and arrhythmia ECG datasets obtained from the PhysioNet website. The raw ECG data are preprocessed using different filters and then the features are extracted based on morphological values of the waveform. Twelve features are extracted and these are used to train classifiers to classify normal and abnormal ECG data. For SVM classifier, the accuracy is around 87% while for artificial neural network, MATLAB's pattern recognition app is used where the classification accuracy found is around 90 % - 93%. The accuracy varies for different numbers of hidden neurons. Diverse ECG databases are used to prove the efficacy and robustness of the use of proposed morphological features and obtained results are compared with existing state-of-the-art research works. This work can be further developed in the future by incorporating deep learning for better performance and it can eventually help to detect cardiac diseases.  © 2020 IEEE.;ANN--classification--ECG--morphological features--SVM;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Data mining--Deep learning--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Neural networks--Pattern recognition--Support vector machines--Cardiac disease--Cardio-vascular disease--Classification accuracy--Electrical activities--Electrical signal--Morphological features--State of the art--SVM classifiers--Biomedical signal processing;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85096417244

Early-stage CAD can progress if undiagnosed and left untreated, leading to myocardial infarction (MI) that may induce irreversible heart muscle damage, resulting in heart chamber remodeling and eventual congestive heart failure (CHF). Electrocardiography (ECG) signals can be useful to detect established MI, and may also be helpful for early diagnosis of CAD. For the latter especially, the ECG perturbations can be subtle and potentially misclassified during manual interpretation and/or when analyzed by traditional algorithms found in ECG instrumentation. For automated diagnostic systems (ADS), deep learning techniques are favored over conventional machine learning techniques, due to the automatic feature extraction and selection processes involved. This paper highlights various deep learning algorithms exploited for the classification of ECG signals into CAD, MI, and CHF conditions. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), followed by combined CNN and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, appear to be the most useful architectures for classification. A 16-layer LSTM model was developed in our study and validated using 10-fold cross-validation. A classification accuracy of 98.5% was achieved. Our proposed model has the potential to be a useful diagnostic tool in hospitals for the classification of abnormal ECG signals. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.;10-fold validation--Cardiovascular diseases--Congestive heart failure--Convolutional neural network--Coronary artery disease--Deep learning--Long short-term memory--Myocardial infarction;Coronary Artery Disease--Deep Learning--Electrocardiography--Heart Diseases--Heart Failure--Humans--Myocardial Infarction--Neural Networks, Computer--Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted--Brain--Cardiology--Computer aided diagnosis--Convolution--Deep learning--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Feature extraction--Heart--Learning algorithms--Long short-term memory--10-fold validation--Cardio-vascular disease--Congestive heart failures--Convolutional neural network--Coronary artery disease--Myocardial Infarction--algorithm--Article--congestive heart failure--convolutional neural network--coronary artery disease--deep learning--diagnostic accuracy--discrete wavelet transform--electrocardiography--empirical mode decomposition--heart infarction--human--long short term memory network--predictive value--priority journal--coronary artery disease--diagnostic imaging--electrocardiography--heart disease--heart failure--heart infarction--pathology--procedures--signal processing--Biomedical signal processing;Elsevier B.V.;32143796;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85078118348

Increasing of healthcare datasets and its performance, the past two decades have seen an exponential progress in publications on AI. However, with the advent of increased computational power, availability of AI devices was increased. There are two main devices in AI, machine learning, where structured data (i.e. images, EP and genetic data) are analyzed and natural language processing, where unstructured data are analyzed. Both AI devices have been improved in great detail over the past two decades for its methods, algorithms, and applications. However, various attempts and new methods of AI have been used in recent years and few diseases such as cancer, nervous system disease, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, congenital cataract disease, etc. were potentially analyzed using AI. Now a day an advanced method called deep learning has initiated a boom of AI and great modifications of diagnostic medical imaging systems like endoscopic diagnosis, pathology and dermatology will be expected in the near future.

Although the CVD risk often depends on the race and ethnicity, most previous studies considered only US or European populations for the CVD risk prediction. In this work, to complement previous researches, we analyzed the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Health Sample Cohort (KNHSC) data and studied the characteristics of ML and big data for predicting the CVD risk. More specifically, we assessed the effectiveness of various ML methods in predicting the 2-year and 10-year risk of CVD such as atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and strokes. To develop prediction models, we considered the usual medical examination data, questionnaire survey results, comorbidities, and past medication information available in the KNHSC data. We developed various ML-based prediction models using logistic regression, deep neural networks, random forests, and LightGBM, and validated them using various metrics such as receiver operating characteristic curves, precision-recall curves, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. Experimental results showed that all ML models outperformed the baseline method derived from the ACC/AHA guidelines for estimating the 10-year CVD risk, demonstrating the usefulness of ML methods. In addition, in our analysis, whether we included the past medication information as a feature or not, the prediction accuracy of all ML models was comparable to each other. Since the use of medications by the physicians provided important information on the occurrence of diseases, when we included it as a feature, all prediction models achieved a slightly higher prediction accuracy.  © 2013 IEEE.;Atrial fibrillation--cardiovascular disease--coronary artery disease--heart failure--Korean national health insurance data--machine learning--stroke;Big data--Cardiology--Decision trees--Deep learning--Deep neural networks--Diagnosis--Diseases--Forecasting--Health insurance--Health risks--Logistic regression--Predictive analytics--Risk assessment--Risk perception--Surveys--Accurate prediction--Atrial fibrillation--Cardiovascular disease--Coronary artery disease--Medical examination data--Prediction accuracy--Questionnaire surveys--Receiver operating characteristic curves--Learning systems;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85091235228

Rapid advances in handheld imaging devices with other mHealth devices such as smartphone apps and wearable devices are making great strides in the field of cardiovascular imaging like never before. Although these technologies offer a bright promise in cardiovascular imaging, it is far from straightforward. The massive data influx from telemedicine and mHealth including cardiovascular imaging supersedes the existing capabilities of current healthcare system and statistical software. Artificial intelligence with machine learning is the one and only way to navigate through this complex maze of the data influx through various approaches. Deep learning techniques are further expanding their role by image recognition and automated measurements. Artificial intelligence provides limitless opportunity to rigorously analyze data. As we move forward, the futures of mHealth, telemedicine and artificial intelligence are increasingly becoming intertwined to give rise to precision medicine. © 2019 Echo Research and Practice.

However, the potential for AI to facilitate the identification of factors contributing to human exceptional health and life span and their translation into novel interventions for enhancing health and life span has not yet been realized. As researchers on aging acquire large scale data both in human cohorts and model organisms, emerging opportunities exist for the application of AI approaches to untangle the complex physiologic process(es) that modulate health and life span. It is expected that efficient and novel data mining tools that could unravel molecular mechanisms and causal pathways associated with exceptional health and life span could accelerate the discovery of novel therapeutics for healthy aging. Keeping this in mind, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) convened an interdisciplinary workshop titled “Contributions of Artificial Intelligence to Research on Determinants and Modulation of Health Span and Life Span” in August 2018. The workshop involved experts in the fields of aging, comparative biology, cardiology, cancer, and computational science/AI who brainstormed ideas on how AI can be leveraged for the analyses of large-scale data sets from human epidemiological studies and animal/model organisms to close the current knowledge gaps in processes that drive exceptional life and health span. This report summarizes the discussions and recommendations from the workshop on future application of AI approaches to advance our understanding of human health and life span. © Copyright © 2019 Moore, Raghavachari and Workshop Speakers.;artificial intelligence--deep learning, comparative biology--GWAS--health span and life span--machine learning--protective factors--systems approach;;Frontiers Media S.A.;;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85076003874

This is proved by the high mortality rates annually published. The factors and symptoms of this disease which are significantly common among other diseases, grabbed the attention of the scientific community to integrate advanced tools and computing systems such as Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to early diagnose and predict this disease. Among recent research work, Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) formed a viable model to solve similar problems in the medical domain. Therefore, we introduce this paper to present a heart disease classification system based on RBM. In this paper, we relied on a standard dataset, namely the Cleveland dataset to conduct our experimental work. In addition, we developed a meta-learning framework to train stacked RBM classifiers, where we use the same type of classifier with different levels of abstractions of the data to get several classifications. The experimental results show that our proposed model achieves an accuracy that is on par with the state-of-the-art. © 2019 IEEE.;Heart disease--Meta-Learning--Multilayer Perceptron--Restricted Boltzmann Machines;Cardiology--Diseases--Medical problems--Neural networks--Computing system--Levels of abstraction--Medical domains--Meta-learning frameworks--Recent researches--Restricted boltzmann machine--Scientific community--State of the art--Deep learning;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85087633102

Recent advances in unsupervised machine learning on electronic health record (EHR) data have enabled researchers to discover phenotypes without input from domain experts. However, most existing studies have ignored time and modeled diseases as discrete events. Uncovering the evolution of phenotypes – how they emerge, evolve and contribute to health outcomes – is essential to define more precise phenotypes and refine the understanding of disease progression. Our objective was to assess the benefits of an unsupervised approach that incorporates time to model diseases as dynamic processes in phenotype discovery. Methods: In this study, we applied a constrained non-negative tensor-factorization approach to characterize the complexity of cardiovascular disease (CVD) patient cohort based on longitudinal EHR data. Through tensor-factorization, we identified a set of phenotypic topics (i.e., subphenotypes) that these patients established over the 10 years prior to the diagnosis of CVD, and showed the progress pattern. For each identified subphenotype, we examined its association with the risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes estimated by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Pooled Cohort Risk Equations, a conventional CVD-risk assessment tool frequently used in clinical practice. Furthermore, we compared the subsequent myocardial infarction (MI) rates among the six most prevalent subphenotypes using survival analysis. Results: From a cohort of 12,380 adult CVD individuals with 1068 unique PheCodes, we successfully identified 14 subphenotypes. Through the association analysis with estimated CVD risk for each subtype, we found some phenotypic topics such as Vitamin D deficiency and depression, Urinary infections cannot be explained by the conventional risk factors. Through a survival analysis, we found markedly different risks of subsequent MI following the diagnosis of CVD among the six most prevalent topics (p < 0.0001), indicating these topics may capture clinically meaningful subphenotypes of CVD. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential benefits of using tensor-decomposition to model diseases as dynamic processes from longitudinal EHR data. Our results suggest that this data-driven approach may potentially help researchers identify complex and chronic disease subphenotypes in precision medicine research. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.;Computational phenotyping--Deep phenotyping--Tensor decomposition;Academic Medical Centers--Algorithms--Cardiovascular Diseases--Databases, Factual--Electronic Health Records--Humans--Medical Informatics--Myocardial Infarction--Phenotype--Precision Medicine--Risk--Risk Factors--Societies, Medical--United States--Unsupervised Machine Learning--Urinary Tract Infections--Vitamin D Deficiency--Bioinformatics--Cardiology--Diagnosis--Factorization--Records management--Risk assessment--Risk perception--Tensors--Cardiovascular disease--Electronic health record--Myocardial Infarction--Phenotyping--Risk assessment tool--Tensor decomposition--Unsupervised approaches--Unsupervised machine learning--adult--Article--cardiovascular disease--cardiovascular risk--case study--chronic disease--clinical assessment tool--clinical practice--clinical research--cohort analysis--controlled study--data analysis--depression--disease association--disease classification--electronic medical record--heart infarction--human--machine learning--major clinical study--male--mathematical analysis--medical record review--medical society--mouse--nonhuman--personalized medicine--phenotype--priority journal--retrospective study--survival analysis--tensor factorization--urinary tract infection--vitamin D deficiency--algorithm--cardiovascular disease--complication--electronic health record--factual database--medical informatics--procedures--risk--risk factor--United States--university hospital--unsupervised machine learning--urinary tract infection--Diseases;Academic Press Inc.;31445983;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85071319701

In this study, we applied machine learning and deep learning models to 10-year CVD event prediction by using longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) and genetic data. Our study cohort included 109, 490 individuals. In the first experiment, we extracted aggregated and longitudinal features from EHR. We applied logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting trees, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) units. In the second experiment, we applied a late-fusion approach to incorporate genetic features. We compared the performance with approaches currently utilized in routine clinical practice – American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Pooled Cohort Risk Equation. Our results indicated that incorporating longitudinal feature lead to better event prediction. Combining genetic features through a late-fusion approach can further improve CVD prediction, underscoring the importance of integrating relevant genetic data whenever available. © 2019, The Author(s).;;Adult--Algorithms--Cardiovascular Diseases--Case-Control Studies--Cross-Sectional Studies--Deep Learning--Electronic Health Records--Female--Genetic Variation--Humans--Longitudinal Studies--Machine Learning--Male--Neural Networks, Computer--Risk Factors--United States--adult--algorithm--cardiovascular disease--case control study--cross-sectional study--electronic health record--female--genetic variation--human--longitudinal study--machine learning--male--risk factor--United States;Nature Publishing Group;30679510;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85060531623

Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of deaths worldwide, representing almost 31% of all global fatalities, many of these being premature, preventable deaths. We collected all the relevant data of recent times in the field of personalized cardiovascular medicine to give an abstract overview of the work done in the past concerning individual fields of cardiology where most of the research was done. We also focused on the fact of whether it involved diagnostic or therapeutic strategies with an insight into its impact on clinical decision support systems. We have reviewed these articles by forming several research questions, and the answers to those questions, when sought and discussed, provide a glimpse of all the pertinent past data in personalized cardiovascular care. It also gives an insight into those areas which are well on course to catch the eye of future researchers. We have concluded with some suggestions for future work, which includes involvement of deep learning techniques through machine learning to make clinical decision support systems, which in turn can help modern-day clinicians to make this world much healthier than before. © 2020 IEEE.;Cardiology--Clinical Decision System--Machine Learning--Precision Medicine;Cardiology--Decision support systems--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Personalized medicine--Cardio-vascular disease--Cardiovascular care--Clinical decision support systems--Clinical decision system--Learning techniques--Research questions--Therapeutic strategy--Learning systems;IEEE Computer Society;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85082135034

Not only has DL profoundly affected the healthcare industry it has also influenced global businesses. Within a span of very few years, advances such as self-driving cars, robots performing jobs that are hazardous to human, and chat bots talking with human operators have proved that DL has already made large impact on our lives. The open source nature of DL and decreasing prices of computer hardware will further propel such changes. In healthcare, the potential is immense due to the need to automate the processes and evolve error free paradigms. The sheer quantum of DL publications in healthcare has surpassed other domains growing at a very fast pace, particular in radiology. It is therefore imperative for the radiologists to learn about DL and how it differs from other approaches of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The next generation of radiology will see a significant role of DL and will likely serve as the base for augmented radiology (AR). Better clinical judgement by AR will help in improving the quality of life and help in life saving decisions, while lowering healthcare costs. A comprehensive review of DL as well as its implications upon the healthcare is presented in this review. We had analysed 150 articles of DL in healthcare domain from PubMed, Google Scholar, and IEEE EXPLORE focused in medical imagery only. We have further examined the ethic, moral and legal issues surrounding the use of DL in medical imaging. © 2019;Deep learning--Machine learning--Medical imaging--Radiology;Artificial Intelligence--Deep Learning--Delivery of Health Care--Forecasting--Humans--Quality of Life--Radiologists--Radiology--arterial wall thickness--artificial intelligence--brain ischemia--cardiology--computer assisted tomography--decision making--deep learning--fatty liver--health care cost--human--priority journal--privacy--prognosis--prostate cancer--quality of life--radiologist--radiology--respiratory tract disease--Review--risk factor--safety--urology--forecasting--health care delivery--radiology--standards--statistics and numerical data--trends;Elsevier Ireland Ltd;31005165;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85062451021

These data are multi-dimensional in nature, resulting out of various tests performed on the patients. The data includes variety of attributes, its values, graphs/charts/images with different colors and legends etc. Collecting all this data together what can be perceived or understood? Can any pattern may be generated out of it? What knowledge we may find from this data? Will the Patterns and knowledge generated from this huge data, lead to risk factors identification of the disease for say cardio related or respiratory related diseases? These are the questions which are basically forming the foundation for big data analytics in healthcare sector. This survey article attempts to understand and determine the validity and applicability of these questions in predicting the risk factors for diagnosing. In current scenario, the diagnosis is based on analysis of visual identical patterns of medical data of individual patients. The main limitation of this method is time consuming and the accuracy depends on the experience of the person who is handling it. The diagnosis is done to understand the cause and factors of the disease. Instead of doctors playing a vital role in identifying the risk factors and cause of the diseases, machines with intelligence can be more effective. This article also bids to understand the role of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the field of biomedical healthcare. This article enfolds a brief literature survey on prediction of heart disease by using different data mining techniques. © 2018 IEEE.;Big Data--Data Mining--Deep learning--Disease Prediction--Machine Learningg;Big data--Cardiology--Data Analytics--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Forecasting--Health care--Learning systems--Pathology--Surveys--Cardio-vascular disease--Critical data--Healthcare sectors--Healthcare technology--Literature survey--Mining machines--Multi dimensional--Prediction of heart disease--Data mining;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85082663784

Shape-based representation is imperative to such an estimation process, where correspondence-based representation offers the most flexibility and ease-of-computation for population-level shape statistics. Nonetheless, population-level shape representations in the form of image segmentation and correspondence models derived from cardiac MRI require significant human resources with sufficient anatomy-specific expertise. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach that uses deep networks to estimate AF recurrence by predicting shape descriptors directly from MRI images, with NO image pre-processing involved. We also propose a novel data augmentation scheme to effectively train a deep network in a limited training data setting. We compare this new method of estimating shape descriptors from images with the state-of-the-art correspondence-based shape modeling that requires image segmentation and correspondence optimization. Results show that the proposed method and the current state-of-the-art produce statistically similar outcomes on AF recurrence, eliminating the need for expensive pre-processing pipelines and associated human labor. © 2018 Creative Commons Attribution.;;Cardiology--Diseases--Human form models--Image segmentation--Magnetic resonance imaging--Pipeline processing systems--Population statistics--Atrial fibrillation--Data augmentation--Estimation process--Image preprocessing--Independent predictors--Limited training data--Machine learning approaches--Shape representation--Deep learning;IEEE Computer Society;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85068765820

A higher accuracy of heart diseases needs an automatic classification for intelligent interpretation of cardiac arrhythmia. The classification process consists of following stages: detection of QRS complex in ECG signal, feature extraction from detected QRS using R-R interval, segmentation of rhythms using extracted feature set, learning system by using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The performance is analyzed as a rhythm of arrhythmia classifier and MIT-BIH arrhythmia database uses to validate the method. To benchmark, the performance of DNNs algorithm is compared to, MLP and SVM algorithm in terms of accuracy.

Each type of data provides information that must be properly analyzed for healthcare diagnosis. To simplify the diagnostic process, avoid misdiagnosis as well as early detection, artificial intelligence (AI) that aims to mimic human cognitive functions may be employed. Current AI techniques that are used for structured data include machine learning methods, such as the classical support vector machine, artificial neural network, and the modern deep learning. Natural language processing is mainly used for unstructured data. In this paper, we have adopted artificial neural network by using adaptive learning algorithms to handle diverse types of cardiovascular clinical data and integrate them into categorized major cardiovascular disease outputs such as heart failure, aortic aneurysm, cardiomyopathy, cerebrovascular disease, etc. These outputs are then shared as reports to patients as well as doctors by an efficient report sharing scheme called APDRChain, which combines blockchain and structured peer-to-peer network techniques with clever cryptography to create a consensus mechanism. The evaluation results show that APDRChain can achieve higher efficiency and satisfy the security requirements in report sharing. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;Artificial neural network--Blockchain--Cryptography--Healthcare data--Medical diagnosis--Report sharing;Artificial heart--Blockchain--Cardiology--Cryptography--Deep learning--Health care--Learning algorithms--Natural language processing systems--Neural networks--Peer to peer networks--Personal computing--Philosophical aspects--Support vector machines--Adaptive learning algorithm--Cardio-vascular disease--Cerebrovascular disease--Machine learning methods--NAtural language processing--Report sharing--Security requirements--Structured peer-to-peer networks--Diagnosis;Springer;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85076838202

However, low heart disease prediction accuracy is still a problem in these systems. For better heart risk prediction accuracy, we propose a feature selection method that uses a floating window with adaptive size for feature elimination (FWAFE). After the feature elimination, two kinds of classification frameworks are utilized, i.e., artificial neural network (ANN) and deep neural network (DNN). Thus, two types of hybrid diagnostic systems are proposed in this paper, i.e., FWAFE-ANN and FWAFE-DNN. Experiments are performed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed methods on a dataset collected from Cleveland online heart disease database. The strength of the proposed methods is appraised against accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. Experimental outcomes confirm that the proposed models outperformed eighteen other proposed methods in the past, which attained accuracies in the range of 50.00-91.83%. Moreover, the performance of the proposed models is impressive as compared with that of the other state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for heart disease diagnosis. Furthermore, the proposed systems can help the physicians to make accurate decisions while diagnosing heart disease. © 2020 Ashir Javeed et al.;;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Deep neural networks--Diagnosis--Diseases--Feature extraction--Forecasting--Heart--Learning systems--Classification framework--Correlation coefficient--Feature selection methods--Heart disease diagnosis--Hybrid diagnostic systems--Intelligent diagnostic systems--Machine learning techniques--Receiver operating characteristics curves (ROC)--Neural networks;Hindawi Limited;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85091999807

Deep neural networks have shown the potentials to improve the accuracies of arrhythmia detection based on electrocardiograms (ECGs). However, more ECG records with ground truth are needed to promote the development and progression of deep learning techniques in automatic ECG analysis. Here we propose a web-based tool for ECG viewing and annotating, LabelECG. With the facilitation of unified data management, LabelECG is able to distribute large cohorts of ECGs to dozens of technicians and physicians, who can simultaneously make annotations through web-browsers on PCs, tablets and cell phones. Along with the doctors from four hospitals in China, we applied LabelECG to support the annotations of about 15,000 12-lead resting ECG records in three months. These annotated ECGs have successfully supported the First China ECG intelligent Competition.

This phenomenon has inspired us to develop this work for delineation of myocardial infarction area directly from non-contrast agents cardiac MR imaging sequences. The main contribution of this work is to develop a new joint motion feature learning architecture to efficiently establish direct correspondences between motion features and tissue properties. This architecture consists of three seamless connected function layers: the heart localization layers can automatically crop the region of interest (ROI) sequences involving the left ventricle from the cardiac MR imaging sequences--the motion feature extraction layers, using long short-term memory-recurrent neural networks, a) builds patch-based motion features through local intensity changes between fixed-size patch sequences (cropped from image sequences), and b) uses optical flow techniques to build image-based features through global intensity changes between adjacent images to describe the motion of each pixel--the fully connected discriminative layers can combine two types of motion features together in each pixel and then build the correspondences between motion features and tissue identities (that is, infarct or not) in each pixel. We validated the performance of our framework in 165 cine cardiac MR imaging datasets by comparing to the ground truths manually segmented from delayed Gadolinium-enhanced MR cardiac images by two radiologists with more than 10 years of experience. Our experimental results show that our proposed method has a high and stable accuracy (pixel-level: 95.03%) and consistency (Kappa statistic: 0.91--Dice: 89.87%--RMSE: 0.72 mm--Hausdorff distance: 5.91 mm) compared to manual delineation results. Overall, the advantage of our framework is that it can determine the tissue identity in each pixel from its motion pattern captured by normal cine cardiac MR images, which makes it an attractive tool for the clinical diagnosis of infarction. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.;Deep learning--Motion feature--Myocardial infarction--Optical flow;Heart Ventricles--Humans--Magnetic Resonance Imaging--Motion--Myocardial Infarction--Biomechanics--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Heart--Image segmentation--Magnetic resonance imaging--Network architecture--Optical flows--Pixels--Recurrent neural networks--Tissue--gadolinium pentetate meglumine--Clinical diagnosis--Hausdorff distance--Image-based features--Motion feature extraction--Motion features--Myocardial Infarction--Optical flow techniques--The region of interest (ROI)--algorithm--Article--clinical feature--controlled study--disease classification--false positive result--feature extraction--heart infarction--heart left ventricle--human--image analysis--image enhancement--kappa statistics--learning--major clinical study--nuclear magnetic resonance imaging--optic flow--priority journal--retrospective study--short term memory--ST segment elevation myocardial infarction--support vector machine--velocity--heart infarction--heart ventricle--motion--pathophysiology--procedures--Image enhancement;Elsevier B.V.;30227385;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85053287118

Therefore, it is urgent to improve heart disease diagnostic accuracy. This research combines profound neural networks and information from the ECG to create an ECG classifier for left ventricular hypertrophy. The classification system uses data preprocessing to impute missing values of ECG data, which can be collected from IoT equipment and monitor the body situation quickly, and transform these data for use by the deep neural network. Then, the data is input into a six-layers deep neural network designed for this study and is used to predict left ventricular hypertrophy. L2-regularization and dropout are used to avoid overfitting in each model iteration. The system has been named the electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy classifier (ELVHC). The experimental findings demonstrate that the forecast model’s precision is 73%, the sensitivity is 66%, and the specificity is 78%, which is considerably greater than two clinical techniques. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.;Deep neural network--Electrocardiogram--Left ventricular hypertrophy--Machine learning;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Forecasting--Iterative methods--Learning systems--Multilayer neural networks--Network layers--Pathology--Classification system--Clinical techniques--Data preprocessing--Electrocardiogram analysis--FORECAST model--Left ventricular hypertrophies--Missing values--Model iterations--Deep neural networks;Springer;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85081931625

We review the evolutionary potential of machine learning (ML), a subset of artificial intelligence, as an adjunct to MPI. Recent Findings: Applying the broad scope of ML, including the integration of deep learning, can leverage the knowledge representation and automated reasoning to detect and extrapolate patterns from high-dimensional features of MPI. There is growing evidence to suggest superior abilities of ML over parametric statistical models for predicting the presence of obstructive CAD, the need for revascularization, and the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events including cardiac death. Summary: ML is uniquely positioned to provide the next great advancement in the field of nuclear cardiology for improving patient-specific risk stratification. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.;Artificial intelligence--Coronary artery disease--Machine learning--Myocardial perfusion imaging--Nuclear cardiology;artificial intelligence--cardiology--cardiovascular disease--coronary angiography--coronary artery disease--diagnostic accuracy--digital imaging and communications in medicine--heart death--heart left ventricle ejection fraction--heart muscle ischemia--heart muscle perfusion--heart muscle revascularization--human--image analysis--machine learning--mitral valve--mitral valve surgery--myocardial perfusion imaging--nuclear cardiology--positron emission tomography--predictive value--Review--scintiscanning--single photon emission computed tomography;Current Medicine Group LLC 1;;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85063198010

However, the need for human interpretation has limited echocardiography’s full potential for precision medicine. Deep learning is an emerging tool for analyzing images but has not yet been widely applied to echocardiograms, partly due to their complex multi-view format. The essential first step toward comprehensive computer-assisted echocardiographic interpretation is determining whether computers can learn to recognize these views. We trained a convolutional neural network to simultaneously classify 15 standard views (12 video, 3 still), based on labeled still images and videos from 267 transthoracic echocardiograms that captured a range of real-world clinical variation. Our model classified among 12 video views with 97.8% overall test accuracy without overfitting. Even on single low-resolution images, accuracy among 15 views was 91.7% vs. 70.2–84.0% for board-certified echocardiographers. Data visualization experiments showed that the model recognizes similarities among related views and classifies using clinically relevant image features. Our results provide a foundation for artificial intelligence-assisted echocardiographic interpretation. © 2018, The Author(s).;;Computer aided analysis--Deep learning--Echocardiography--Neural networks--Classifieds--Computer assisted--Convolutional neural network--Emerging tools--Learn+--Multi-views--Overfitting--Real-world--Still-images--Test accuracy--adult--aged--Article--artificial intelligence--clinical feature--convolutional neural network--deep learning--echocardiography--female--human--machine learning--major clinical study--male--priority journal--transthoracic echocardiography--workflow--Data visualization;Nature Publishing Group;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85086330988

Recently, with the rapid development of hospital information systems, a large volume of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have been produced, in which AMEs are regularly documented in a free-text manner. In this study, we are concerned with the problem of AME detection by utilizing a large volume of unstructured EHR data. To address this challenge, we propose a neural attention network-based model to incorporate the contextual information of words into AME detection. Specifically, we develop a context-aware attention mechanism to locate salient words with respect to the target AMEs in patient medical records. And then we combine the proposed context attention mechanism with the deep learning tactic to boost the performance of AME detection. We validate our proposed model on a real clinical dataset that consists of 8845 medical records of patients with cardiovascular diseases. The experimental results show that our proposed model advances state-of-the-art models and achieves competitive performance in terms of AME detection. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.;Adverse medical event--Cardiovascular disease--Deep learning--Electronic health record--Neural attention network;Algorithms--Area Under Curve--Cardiovascular Diseases--China--Databases, Factual--Deep Learning--Electronic Health Records--Hemorrhage--Hospital Information Systems--Hospitals--Humans--Medical Informatics--Myocardial Ischemia--Myocardial Revascularization--Neural Networks (Computer)--Cardiology--Deep learning--Records management--Adverse medical event--Cardio-vascular disease--Competitive performance--Contextual information--Electronic health record--Electronic health record (EHRs)--Hospital information systems--Network-based modeling--adverse event--Article--artificial neural network--bleeding--cardiovascular disease--electronic health record--health service--hospital information system--human--ischemia--logistic regression analysis--neural attention network--priority journal--revascularization--support vector machine--algorithm--area under the curve--cardiovascular disease--China--electronic health record--factual database--heart muscle ischemia--heart muscle revascularization--hospital--medical informatics--procedures--Diseases;Academic Press Inc.;30336262;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85055088515

It has risen as the most terrifying ailment around the world. Actually, in India, these issues are progressively awful--according to the Journal of the American College of Cardiology in India, the demise rate because of cardiovascular maladies increments around 34% in the middle of 1990–2016. Presently, we are in a time of data age where a huge quantity and variety of information is stored in different enterprises like retail, producing, medical clinic, and online networking.

For an effective treatment of CVDs, automatic CVDs detection based on Electrocardiograph (ECG) monitoring is highly desirable. One major challenge in ECG classification is feature learning. This paper reviews developed techniques for feature extraction and compared their performances in Atrial Fibrillation (AF), Myocardial Infarction (MI) and Pericarditis detection. Feature extraction methods in the literature reviews can be divided into mainly four categories: linear feature, nonlinear feature, wavelet transform, deep learning. Three studies were implemented using database from PhysioNet to evaluate the effectiveness of different feature extraction techniques. The AF detection algorithm use morphology features, statistic features, spectral feature, and wavelet entropy, presented a sensitivity of 96%, specificity of 93% and accuracy of 94.1%. In the case of Pericarditis and MI classification, information thoery-based features including subband energy, permutation entropy, and approximate entropy are the most noteworthy features. The study of detecting MI using machine learning based model of Convolutional Neural Network showed a sensitivity of 92.04% which yield the most promising results. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;Cardiovascular diseases detection--Deep learning--ECG--Feature extraction techniques--Linear feature--Nonlinear feature--Wavelet transform;Biomedical engineering--Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Deep learning--Developing countries--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Entropy--Extraction--Machine learning--Neural networks--Wavelet transforms--Approximate entropy--Cardio-vascular disease--Convolutional neural network--Feature extraction methods--Feature extraction techniques--Linear feature--Myocardial Infarction--Nonlinear features--Feature extraction;Springer Verlag;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85067559421

Cardiovascular disease prevention is one of the most important tasks of any health care system as about 50 million people are at risk of heart disease in the world. Although automatic analysis of ECG signal is very popular, current methods are not satisfactory. The goal of our research was to design a new method based on deep learning to efficiently and quickly classify cardiac arrhythmias. Described research are based on 1000 ECG signal fragments from the MIT - BIH Arrhythmia database for one lead (MLII) from 45 persons. Approach based on the analysis of 10-s ECG signal fragments (not a single QRS complex) is applied (on average, 13 times less classifications/analysis). A complete end-to-end structure was designed instead of the hand-crafted feature extraction and selection used in traditional methods. Our main contribution is to design a new 1D-Convolutional Neural Network model (1D-CNN). The proposed method is 1) efficient, 2) fast (real-time classification) 3) non-complex and 4) simple to use (combined feature extraction and selection, and classification in one stage). Deep 1D-CNN achieved a recognition overall accuracy of 17 cardiac arrhythmia disorders (classes) at a level of 91.33% and classification time per single sample of 0.015 s. Compared to the current research, our results are one of the best results to date, and our solution can be implemented in mobile devices and cloud computing. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;cardiac arrhythmias--Convolutional neural networks--Deep learning--ECG classification;Adult--Aged--Aged, 80 and over--Algorithms--Arrhythmias, Cardiac--Cardiovascular Diseases--Cloud Computing--Deep Learning--Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted--Electrocardiography--Electronic Data Processing--Female--Humans--Machine Learning--Male--Middle Aged--Neural Networks (Computer)--Pacemaker, Artificial--Reproducibility of Results--Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted--Software--Telemedicine--Young Adult--Cardiology--Complex networks--Convolution--Deep learning--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Extraction--Feature extraction--Health risks--Heart--mHealth--Mobile telecommunication systems--Neural networks--Signal analysis--Arrhythmia detection--Cardiac arrhythmia--Cardio-vascular disease--Classification time--Convolutional neural network--Deep convolutional neural networks--Ecg classifications--Feature extraction and selection--adult--aged--Article--artificial neural network--clinical article--cloud computing--convolutional neural network--disease classification--electrocardiography--extraction--feature extraction--female--heart arrhythmia--human--male--priority journal--algorithm--artificial heart pacemaker--artificial neural network--cardiovascular disease--computer assisted diagnosis--electrocardiography--heart arrhythmia--information processing--machine learning--middle aged--procedures--reproducibility--signal processing--software--telemedicine--very elderly--young adult--Biomedical signal processing;Elsevier Ltd;30245122;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85053715332

The methods use videos of skin during the pitting-test, which are processed by machine learning or deep learning techniques to provide classification into one of four edema stages.

Currently, there are a lot of machine learning methods which can be utilized for analyzing and classifying the E C G beats. However, the foremost shortcomings of these traditional machine learning solutions are use of a shallow structured classifier and hand-crafted suitable features. In this paper, we propose a nine-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) that can automatically extract appropriate features and detect the different categories of E C G beats based on individual records. Ten-fold cross-validation strategy is designed that boosts the robustness of our proposed CNN model. Our dataset consists of three types of E C G beats, namely: normal beat (N), premature ventricular contraction beat (V), and right bundle branch block beat (R). The experimental results demonstrate that with an appropriate choice of structure and parameters, our proposed deep learning model can classify the E C G hearts with a diagnose sensitivity of 98.37%, specificity of 99.19%, and accuracy of 98.92%. This proposed algorithm model can serve as an auxiliary tool to assist the clinicians for their diagnosis.

To prevent CVD, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) imaging, a noninvasive ultrasonography method, has proven to be clinically valuable in identifying at-risk persons before adverse events. Researchers are developing systems to automate CIMT video interpretation based on deep learning, but such efforts are impeded by the lack of large annotated CIMT video datasets. CIMT video annotation is not only tedious, laborious, and time consuming, but also demanding of costly, specialty-oriented knowledge and skills, which are not easily accessible. To dramatically reduce the cost of CIMT video annotation, this paper makes three main contributions. Our first contribution is a new concept, called Annotation Unit (AU), which simplifies the entire CIMT video annotation process down to six simple mouse clicks. Our second contribution is a new algorithm, called AFT (active fine-tuning), which naturally integrates active learning and transfer learning (fine-tuning) into a single framework. AFT starts directly with a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), focuses on selecting the most informative and representative AU s from the unannotated pool for annotation, and then fine-tunes the CNN by incorporating newly annotated AU s in each iteration to enhance the CNN’s performance gradually. Our third contribution is a systematic evaluation, which shows that, in comparison with the state-of-the-art method (Tajbakhsh et al., IEEE Trans Med Imaging 35(5):1299–1312, 2016), our method can cut the annotation cost by >81% relative to their training from scratch and >50% relative to their random selection. This performance is attributed to the several advantages derived from the advanced active, continuous learning capability of our AFT method. © 2018, Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.;Active learning--Cardiovascular disease--Transfer learning;Carotid Arteries--Carotid Intima-Media Thickness--Humans--Machine Learning--Ultrasonography--Video Recording--Cardiology--Diseases--Iterative methods--Mammals--Neural networks--Active Learning--Cardio-vascular disease--Carotid intima-media thickness--Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)--State-of-the-art methods--Systematic evaluation--Transfer learning--World Health Organization--arterial wall thickness--carotid artery--classification--diagnostic imaging--echography--human--machine learning--procedures--videorecording--Deep learning;Springer New York LLC;30402668;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85056356641

Box 1982, Dammam, Saudi Arabia;The field of medical analysis is often referred to be a valuable source of rich information. Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is one of the major causes of death all around the world therefore early detection of CHD can help reduce these rates. The challenge lies in the complexity of the data and correlations when it comes to prediction using conventional techniques. The aim of this research is to use the historical medical data to predict CHD using Machine Learning (ML) technology. The scope of this research is limited to using three supervised learning techniques namely Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT), to discover correlations in CHD data that might help improving the prediction rate. Using the South African Heart Disease dataset of 462 instances, intelligent models are derived by the considered ML techniques using 10-fold cross validation. Empirical results using different performance evaluation measures report that probabilistic models derived by NB are promising in detecting CHD. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.;Coronary Heart Disease--Data Mining--Machine Learning--Medical Informatics--Supervised Learning;Cardiology--Data mining--Decision trees--Deep learning--Diseases--Forecasting--Heart--Medical computing--Medical informatics--Predictive analytics--Supervised learning--Support vector machines--Trees (mathematics)--10-fold cross-validation--Conventional techniques--Coronary heart disease--Evaluation measures--Experimental analysis--Intelligent models--Medical analysis--Probabilistic models--Learning systems;Association for Computing Machinery;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85071545708

However, ECG feature extraction is required and this may reduce diagnosis accuracy in traditional shallow learning models, while backward propagation (BP) algorithm used by the traditional deep learning models has the disadvantages of local minimization and slow convergence rate. To solve these problems, a new deep learning algorithm called deep kernel extreme learning machine (DKELM) is proposed by combining the extreme learning machine auto-encoder (ELM-AE) and kernel ELM (KELM). In the new DKELM architecture with M+1 hidden layers, ELM-AEs are employed by the front M hidden layers for feature extraction in the unsupervised learning process, which can effectively extract abstract features from the original ECG signal. To overcome the ""dimension disaster"" problem, the kernel function is introduced into ELM to act as classifier by the M+1th hidden layer in the supervised learning process. The experiments demonstrate that DKELM outperforms the BP neural network, support vector machine (SVM), extreme learning machine (ELM), deep auto-encoder (DAE), deep belief network (DBN) in classification accuracy.

Despite the significant burden that CHF poses and despite the ubiquity of sensors in our lives, methods for automatically detecting CHF are surprisingly scarce, even in the research community. We present a method for CHF detection based on heart sounds. The method combines classic Machine-Learning (ML) and end-to-end Deep Learning (DL). The classic ML learns from expert features, and the DL learns from a spectro-temporal representation of the signal. The method was evaluated on recordings from 947 subjects from six publicly available datasets and one CHF dataset that was collected for this study. Using the same evaluation method as a recent PhysoNet challenge, the proposed method achieved a score of 89.3, which is 9.1 higher than the challenge's baseline method. The method's aggregated accuracy is 92.9% (error of 7.1%)--while the experimental results are not directly comparable, this error rate is relatively close to the percentage of recordings labeled as 'unknown' by experts (9.7%). Finally, we identified 15 expert features that are useful for building ML models to differentiate between CHF phases (i.e., in the decompensated phase during hospitalization and in the recompensated phase) with an accuracy of 93.2%. The proposed method shows promising results both for the distinction of recordings between healthy subjects and patients and for the detection of different CHF phases. This may lead to the easier identification of new CHF patients and the development of home-based CHF monitors for avoiding hospitalizations. © 2020 IEEE.;Chronic heart failure--deep learning--heart sounds--machine learning--PCG;Cardiology--Heart--Learning systems--Baseline methods--Chronic heart failures--Error rate--Healthy subjects--Heart sounds--Home-based--Research communities--Temporal representations--Deep learning;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85081097083

The identification of patients with HFrEF in urgent and emergent situations can be delayed in the absence of clinicians skilled in acquiring and interpreting echocardiography (echo) images. Although the standard-of-care for measuring ejection fraction (EF) involves segmentation of the left ventricle in echo, experienced interpreters often opt for visual estimation of EF in clinical settings. In this paper, we mimic this process using dual-channel deep neural networks for segmentation-free classification of echo cine loops: low-risk ((Formula presented.)) vs. high-risk (reduced EF, i.e. (Formula presented.)). The proposed architecture utilises densely connected networks for extraction of unsupervised spatial features. Temporal embedding is then achieved by aggregating these frame-level feature vectors and feeding them through recurrent blocks. We use 949 and 237 clinical echo exams to train and validate the proposed method, respectively. We demonstrate that direct cine-based detection of patients at high-risk of HFrEF is feasible using densely connected convolutional and recurrent-based architectures. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;convolutional--Echocardiography--ejection fraction--recurrent;Cardiology--Deep neural networks--Echocardiography--Network architecture--Clinical settings--Dual channel--Echocardiography Images--Ejection fraction--Heart failure--Left ventricles--Mortality rate--Recurrent--Standard of cares--Visual estimation--accuracy--algorithm--Article--artificial intelligence--artificial neural network--dual channel deep neural network--echocardiography--feature learning (machine learning)--gated recurrent unit network--heart failure with reduced ejection fraction--high risk patient--human--image quality--image segmentation--implementation science--learning algorithm--low risk patient--machine learning--nerve cell network--priority journal--spatial analysis--stochastic model--training--volumetry--Convolution;Taylor and Francis Ltd.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85074052929

Nevertheless, cardiovascular diseases cause about a third of the total global deaths. Does ML work in the cardiology domain and what is the current progress in this regard? To answer this question, we present a systematic review aiming at 1) identifying studies where machine learning algorithms were applied in the domain of cardiology--2) providing an overview based on the existing literature about the state-of-the-art ML algorithms applied in cardiology. Methods: For organizing this review, we adopted the PRISMA statement. We used PubMed as the search engine and identified the search keywords as “Machine Learning”, “Data Mining”, “Cardiology”, and “Cardiovascular” in combinations. Scientific articles and conference papers published between 2013-2017 reporting about implementations of ML algorithms in the domain of cardiology have been included in this review. Results: In total, 27 relevant papers were included. We examined four aspects: the aims of ML systems, the methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics. The major part of the paper was aimed at predicting the risk of mortality. A promising branch of Machine Learning, the ‘Reinforcement Learning’, was also never proposed in the observed papers. Tree-based ensembles are common and show good results, whereas deep neural networks are poorly represented. Most papers (20 of 27) have used datasets that are hardly available for other researchers, e.g. unpublished local registries. We also identified 28 different metrics for model evaluation. This variety of metrics makes it difficult to compare the results of different researches. Conclusion: We suppose that this systematic review will be helpful for researchers developing medical machine learning systems and for cardiology in particular. © 2020 Dudchenko et al.;Cardiology--Machine learning--Natural Language Processing (NLP)--Neural networks--PubMed--Systematic review;accuracy--area under the curve--arterial pressure--artificial neural network--Bayesian learning--cardiac imaging--cardiology--cardiovascular disease--cardiovascular magnetic resonance--cardiovascular system examination--carotid atherosclerosis--classification algorithm--clinical data repository--coronary artery disease--coronary artery obstruction--data base--decision tree--electrocardiography--heart arrhythmia--heart rate--heart sound--human--k nearest neighbor--logistic regression analysis--machine learning--meta analysis (topic)--mortality risk--mortality risk score--multilayer perceptron--natural language processing--obesity--priority journal--random forest--receiver operating characteristic--reinforcement learning (machine learning)--Review--sensitivity and specificity--supervised machine learning--support vector machine--systematic review;Bentham Science Publishers;;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85090652567

Recent advances in machine learning yielded new techniques to train deep neural networks, which resulted in highly successful applications in many pattern recognition tasks such as object detection and speech recognition. To improve the diagnostic accuracy of HF staging, this study evaluates the performance of deep learning-based models on combined features for its categorization. We proposed a novel deep convolutional neural network-Recurrent neural network (CNN-RNN) model for automatic staging of heart failure diseases in real-time and dynamically. We employed the data segmentation and data augmentation pre-processing dataset to make the classification performance of the proposed architecture better. Specifically, this paper use convolutional neural network (CNN) as a feature extractor instead of training the entire network to extract the characteristics of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and form a feature set. We combine the above feature set with other clinical features, feed the combined features to RNN for classification, and finally obtain 5 classification results. Experiments shows that the CNN-RNN model proposed in this paper achieved an accuracy of 97.6%, the sensitivity of 96.3%, specificity of 97.4% and proportion of 97.1% for two seconds of ECG segments. We obtained an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and proportion of 96.2%, 96.9%, 95.7%, and 94.3% respectively for five seconds of ECG duration. The model can be used as an aid to help clinicians confirm their diagnosis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd;Deep CNN-RNN model--Deep learning--Heart failure--Staging model;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Convolution--Convolutional neural networks--Data handling--Deep learning--Deep neural networks--Electrocardiography--Heart--Learning systems--Object detection--Partial discharges--Speech recognition--Classification performance--Classification results--Clinical features--Diagnostic accuracy--Electrocardiogram signal--Heart failure--Learning Based Models--Proposed architectures--adult--Article--automation--clinical feature--convolutional neural network recurrent neural network--deep learning--diagnostic accuracy--disease classification--electrocardiogram--female--heart failure--human--major clinical study--male--priority journal--sensitivity and specificity--staging--Recurrent neural networks;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85063688039

Annotation, segmentation and rhythm classification of ECGs are challenging tasks, especially in the presence of atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias. Our aim is to increase the accuracy of heart rhythm estimation by the use of extreme gradient boosting trees and the development of a deep convolutional neural network for ECG segmentation. Approach: We trained a convolutional neural network with waveforms from PhysioNet databases to annotate QRS complexes, P waves, T waves, noise and interbeat ECG segments that characterize the essences of normal and irregular heart beats. We evaluated true positive rates, positive predictive values and mean absolute differences of our annotation based on reference annotations of the QT and MIT-BIH P-wave database. Moreover, we compared the results with standard QRS detectors and Ecgpuwave. Extreme gradient boosting trees were used to determine the heart rhythm based on hand-crafted features. More precisely, a noise estimation function was used in combination with heart rate and interval data. Furthermore we defined particular features based on ECG morphology, appearance of P waves and detection of irregular beats. We examined the feature importance and identified key features for normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, alternative rhythm and noisy recordings. The classification performance was evaluated externally using F 1 scores by applying the algorithm to the hidden test set provided by the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2017. Main results: The true positive rate of the convolutional neural network in detection of manually revised R peaks in the QT database was and the positive predictive value was . The detection of P and T waves reached a true positive rate of and respectively, given a 50 ms tolerance when comparing the reference to the test annotation set. The rhythm classification performance reached an overall F 1 score of 0.82 when applying the algorithm to the hidden test set.

Both of these two biomarkers are most reliably assessed by segmentation of 3D cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. In several grand challenges in the last years, U-Net architectures have shown impressive results on the provided data. However, in clinical practice, data sets are more diverse considering individual pathologies and image properties derived from different scanner properties. Additionally, specific training data for complex rare diseases like TOF is scarce. For this work, 1) we assessed the accuracy gap when using a publicly available labelled data set (the Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) data set) for training and subsequent applying it to CMR data of TOF patients and vice versa and 2) whether we can achieve similar results when applying the model to a more heterogeneous data base. Multiple deep learning models were trained with four-fold cross validation. Afterwards they were evaluated on the respective unseen CMR images from the other collection. Our results confirm that current deep learning models can achieve excellent results (left ventricle dice of 0.951±0.003/0.941±0.0007 train/validation) within a single data collection. But once they are applied to other pathologies, it becomes apparent how much they overfit to the training pathologies (dice score drops between 0.072±0.001 for the left and 0.165±0.001 for the right ventricle). © 2020 SPIE.;Cardiac magnet resonance imaging (CMR)--Deep learning--Generalisation--Machine learning for surgical applications--Semantic segmentation--Tetralogy of Fallot--U-Net;Cardiology--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Diseases--Heart--Image segmentation--Learning systems--Magnetic resonance imaging--Pathology--Robotics--Surgery--Cardiac magnetic resonance--Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging--Clinical practices--Congenital heart disease--Cross validation--Heterogeneous data--Surgical planning--Tetralogy of Fallot--Medical imaging;SPIE;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85085249585

Accurate epicardial adipose tissue quantification is still an open research issue. Considering that manual approaches are generally user-dependent and time-consuming, computer-assisted tools can considerably improve the result repeatability as well as reduce the time required for performing an accurate segmentation. Unfortunately, fully automatic strategies might not always identify the Region of Interest (ROI) correctly. Moreover, they could require user interaction for handling unexpected events. This paper proposes a semi-automatic method for Epicardial Fat Volume (EFV) segmentation and quantification. Unlike supervised Machine Learning approaches, the method does not require any initial training or modeling phase to set up the system. As a further key novelty, the method also yields a subdivision into quartiles of the adipose tissue density. Quartile-based analysis conveys information about fat densities distribution, enabling an in-depth study towards a possible correlation between fat amounts, fat distribution, and heart diseases. Experimental tests were performed on 50 Calcium Score (CaSc) series and 95 Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CorCTA) series. Area-based and distance-based metrics were used to evaluate the segmentation accuracy, by obtaining Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) = 93.74% and Mean Absolute Distance (MAD) = 2.18 for CaSc, as well as DSC = 92.48% and MAD = 2.87 for CorCTA. Moreover, the Pearson and Spearman coefficients were computed for quantifying the correlation between the ground-truth EFV and the corresponding automated measurement, by obtaining 0.9591 and 0.9490 for CaSc, and 0.9513 and 0.9319 for CorCTA, respectively. In conclusion, the proposed EFV quantification and analysis method represents a clinically useable tool assisting the cardiologist to gain insights into a specific clinical scenario and leading towards personalized diagnosis and therapy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd;Calcium score scans--Cardiac adipose tissue quantification--Coronary computed tomography angiography scans--Epicardial fat volume--Fat density quartiles--Semi-automatic segmentation;Adipose Tissue--Adult--Algorithms--Deep Learning--Female--Humans--Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted--Male--Middle Aged--Pericardium--Tomography, X-Ray Computed--Angiography--Automation--Binary alloys--Calcium alloys--Cardiology--Diseases--Heart--Image segmentation--Scandium alloys--Supervised learning--Tissue--Tissue engineering--Adipose tissue--Calcium score--Computed tomography angiography--Epicardial fat volume--Semi-automatic segmentation--adipose tissue--Article--automation--body fat distribution--computed tomographic angiography--coronary artery calcium score--correlation analysis--density--epicardial fat--heart disease--image segmentation--measurement accuracy--priority journal--quantitative analysis--adipose tissue--adult--algorithm--computer assisted diagnosis--diagnostic imaging--female--human--male--middle aged--pericardium--procedures--x-ray computed tomography--Computerized tomography;Elsevier Ltd;31521896;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85072203314

Furthermore, dealing with measurement inaccuracies and exploiting unsupervised data are considered to be central to improving existing solutions. In particular, a primary objective in predictive modeling is to generalize well to both unseen variations within the observed classes, and unseen classes. In this work, we consider such a challenging problem in machine learning driven diagnosis detecting a gamut of cardiovascular conditions (e.g. infarction, dysrhythmia etc.) from limited channel ECG measurements. Though deep neural networks have achieved unprecedented success in predictive modeling, they rely solely on discriminative models that can generalize poorly to unseen classes. We argue that unsupervised learning can be utilized to construct effective latent spaces that facilitate better generalization. This work extensively compares the generalization of our proposed approach against a state-of-the-art deep learning solution. Our results show significant improvements in F1-scores. © 2018 Creative Commons Attribution.;;Cardiology--Electrocardiography--Large dataset--Machine learning--Balanced datasets--Discriminative models--Limited channels--Machine learning research--Neural network model--Predictive modeling--Primary objective--Unsupervised data--Deep neural networks;IEEE Computer Society;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85068761479

ACS is usually caused by one of three problems: ST elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, or unstable angina. Major adverse cardiac event (MACE) prediction, as a critical tool to estimate the likelihood an individual is at risk of ACS, has been widely adopted in the early prevention and intervention of ACS. Although valuable, existing MACE prediction models are designed to predict the overall probability of MACE occurrence for ACS patients, and lack the ability to look for insight into the disease to distinguish the different subtypes of ACS in a fine-grained manner. It is interesting to exploit the different subtypes of ACS and mine their private and shared underlying knowledge to improve the performance of MACE prediction. In this study, we propose utilizing a large volume of heterogeneous electronic health records for the application of MACE prediction. In detail, we address the multi-subtype-oriented MACE prediction for ACS as a multi-task learning (MTL) problem, present a MTL-based model to predict MACE of ACS patients with the different subtypes, and incorporate adversarial learning into the model to alleviate both the shared and private latent feature spaces of each subtype of ACS from interfering with each other. A real clinical dataset containing 2,863 ACS patient samples is collected from a Chinese hospital to validate the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate that the prediction performance of our proposed model obtains a significant improvement, compared to single-subtype-oriented MACE prediction models. © 2013 IEEE.;acute coronary syndrome--adversarial network--deep learning--electronic health records--MACE Prediction;Acute Coronary Syndrome--Aged--Deep Learning--Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted--Electronic Health Records--Heart Failure--Humans--Medical Informatics--Middle Aged--Models, Statistical--Cardiology--Deep learning--Forecasting--Heart--Learning systems--Linearization--Multi-task learning--Records management--Risk perception--creatine kinase--Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)--Acute coronary syndromes--Adversarial learning--Adversarial networks--Coronary arteries--Electronic health record--Prediction performance--St-elevation myocardial infarctions--acute coronary syndrome--adult--aged--algorithm--area under the curve--Article--clinical practice--controlled study--deep learning--deep neural network--denoising autoencoder--diagnostic test accuracy study--electronic health record--female--hospitalization--human--machine learning--major adverse cardiac event--major clinical study--male--mathematical model--measurement accuracy--middle aged--non ST segment elevation myocardial infarction--prediction--predictive value--receiver operating characteristic--ST segment elevation myocardial infarction--acute coronary syndrome--complication--computer assisted diagnosis--heart failure--medical informatics--mortality--procedures--statistical model--Predictive analytics;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;30475735;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85057143813

Electrocardiogram (ECG) has been widely used for diagnosing heart diseases for its simplicity and non-invasive property. Automatic ECG analyzing technologies are expected to reduce human working load and increase diagnostic efficacy. However, there are still some challenges to be addressed for achieving this goal. In this study, we develop an algorithm to identify multiple abnormalities from 12-lead ECG recordings. In the algorithm pipeline, several preprocessing methods are firstly applied on the ECG data for denoising, augmentation and balancing recording numbers of variant classes. In consideration of efficiency and consistency of data length, the recordings are padded or truncated into a medium length, where the padding/truncating time windows are selected randomly to suppress overfitting. Then, the ECGs are used to train deep neural network (DNN) models with a novel structure that combines a deep residual network with an attention mechanism. Finally, an ensemble model is built based on these trained models to make predictions on the test data set. Our method is evaluated based on the test set of the First China ECG Intelligent Competition dataset by using the F1 metric that is regarded as the harmonic mean between the precision and recall. The resultant overall F1 score of the algorithm is 0.875, showing a promising performance and potential for practical use. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Automatic diagnosis--Deep neural networks--Electrocardiogram--Heart disease;Balancing--Biomedical engineering--Cardiology--Computer aided instruction--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Machine learning--Medical computing--Medical imaging--Statistical tests--Stents--Attention mechanisms--Automatic Detection--Automatic diagnosis--Ensemble modeling--Heart disease--Novel structures--Pre-processing method--Precision and recall--Deep neural networks;Springer;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85075749466

We propose an event detection approach without explicitly incorporating a priori information of the state duration. This renders it also applicable to recordings with cardiac arrhythmia and extendable to the detection of extra heart sounds (third and fourth heart sound), heart murmurs, as well as other acoustic events. Methods: We use data from the 2016 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge, containing heart sound recordings and annotations of the heart sound states. From the recordings, we extract spectral and envelope features and investigate the performance of different deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) architectures to detect the state sequence. We use virtual adversarial training, dropout, and data augmentation for regularization. Results: We compare our results with the state-of-the-art method and achieve an average score for the four events of the state sequence of F                             1                              ≈ 96% on an independent test set.

It combines two sub networks which are convolutional neural network (CNN) and bi-directional recurrent neural network (BRNN). In the model, CNN with one-dimension convolution is employed to extract features for each lead of ECG, and BRNN is used to fuse features of different leads to represent deeper features. In the training step, we use more than 40 thousand training data and more than 19 thousand validation data to obtain the optimal parameters of the model. Besides, by validating our model on more than CCDD 120,000 real data, it achieves an 87.69% accuracy rate, higher than popular deep learning models such as CNN and ResNet. Our model has better accuracy than state-of-the-art models and it is also slightly higher than the average accuracy of human judgement.

Prof. Soedharto SH, Tembalang, Semarang, 50275, Indonesia;The interpretation of Myocardial Infarction (MI) via electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is a challenging task. ECG signals' morphological view show significant variation in different patients under different physical conditions. Several learning algorithms have been studied to interpret MI. However, the drawback of machine learning is the use of heuristic features with shallow feature learning architectures. To overcome this problem, a deep learning approach is used for learning features automatically, without conventional handcrafted features. This paper presents sequence modeling based on deep learning with recurrent network for ECG-rhythm signal classification. The recurrent network architecture such as a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is proposed to automatically interpret MI via ECG signal. The performance of the proposed method is compared to the other recurrent network classifiers such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The objective is to obtain the best sequence model for ECG signal processing. This paper also aims to study a proper data partitioning ratio for the training and testing sets of imbalanced data. The large imbalanced data are obtained from MI and healthy control of PhysioNet: The PTB Diagnostic ECG Database 15-lead ECG signals. According to the comparison result, the LSTM architecture shows better performance than standard RNN and GRU architecture with identical hyper-parameters. The LSTM architecture also shows better classification compared to standard recurrent networks and GRU with sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score, BACC, and MCC is 98.49%, 97.97%, 95.67%, 96.32%, 97.56%, and 95.32%, respectively. Apparently, deep learning with the LSTM technique is a potential method for classifying sequential data that implements time steps in the ECG signal. © 2019 by the authors.;Deep learning--Gated recurrent unit--Long short-term memory--Myocardial infarction--Recurrent neural network--Sequence modeling;Biomedical signal processing--Brain--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Deep learning--Deep neural networks--Electrocardiography--Learning algorithms--Machine learning--Memory architecture--Network architecture--Recurrent neural networks--ECG signal processing--Electrocardiogram signal--Gated recurrent unit--Myocardial Infarction--Recurrent neural network (RNN)--Sequence modeling--Signal classification--Training and testing--Long short-term memory;MDPI AG;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85074353230

Approach: An ECG-derived respiration (EDR) signal and synchronous beat-to-beat heart rate variability (HRV) time series were derived from the ECG using previously described robust algorithms. A measure of cardiorespiratory coupling (CRC) was extracted by calculating the coherence and cross-spectrogram of the EDR and HRV signal in 5 min windows. A CNN was then trained to classify the sleep stages (wake, rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) light sleep and NREM deep sleep) from the corresponding CRC spectrograms. A support vector machine was then used to combine the output of CNN with the other features derived from the ECG, including phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA), sample entropy, as well as standard spectral and temporal HRV measures. The MIT-BIH Polysomnographic Database (SLPDB), the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2018 database (CinC2018) and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) database, all expert-annotated for sleep stages, were used to train and validate the algorithm. Main results: Ten-fold cross validation results showed that the proposed algorithm achieved an accuracy (Acc) of 75.4% and a Cohen's kappa coefficient of = 0.54 on the out of sample validation data in the classification of Wake, REM, NREM light and deep sleep in SLPDB. This rose to Acc = 81.6% and = 0.63 for the classification of Wake, REM sleep and NREM sleep and Acc = 85.1% and = 0.68 for the classification of NREM sleep versus REM/wakefulness in SLPDB. Significance: The proposed ECG-based sleep stage classification approach that represents the highest reported results on non-electroencephalographic data and uses datasets over ten times larger than those in previous studies. By using a state-of-the-art QRS detector and deep learning model, the system does not require human annotation and can therefore be scaled for mass analysis. © 2018 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.;cardiorespiratory coupling--cross-time-frequency domain--deep convolutional neural network--electrocardiogram--sleep stage classification;Deep Learning--Electrocardiography--Humans--Neural Networks (Computer)--Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted--Sleep Stages--Support Vector Machine--Time Factors--Wakefulness--Classification (of information)--Convolution--Database systems--Deep neural networks--Electroencephalography--Eye movements--Frequency domain analysis--Sleep research--Spectrographs--Support vector machines--Wakes--Cardiorespiratory coupling--Convolutional neural network--Cross-time-frequency domain--Heart rate variability--Rapid eye movement--REM sleep--Sleep stage--Sleep stages classifications--Spectrograms--Time frequency domain--artificial neural network--electrocardiography--human--signal processing--sleep stage--support vector machine--time factor--wakefulness--Electrocardiography;IOP Publishing Ltd;30524025;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85058919863

It has been extensively employed to assess molecular and physiological biomarkers in vivo in healthy and disease states, in oncology, cardiology, neurology, and psychiatry. Quantitative PET allows relating the time-varying activity concentration in tissues/organs of interest and the basic functional parameters governing the biological processes being studied. Yet, quantitative PET is challenged by a number of degrading physical factors related to the physics of PET imaging, the limitations of the instrumentation used, and the physiological status of the patient. Moreover, there is no consensus on the most reliable and robust image-derived PET metric(s) that can be used with confidence in clinical oncology owing to the discrepancies between the conclusions reported in the literature. There is also increasing interest in the use of artificial intelligence based techniques, particularly machine learning and deep learning techniques in a variety of applications to extract quantitative features (radiomics) from PET including image segmentation and outcome prediction in clinical oncology. These novel techniques are revolutionizing clinical practice and are now offering unique capabilities to the clinical molecular imaging community and biomedical researchers at large.

PCG signals provide useful information and can help in the early detection and diagnosis of heart diseases. Many studies have attempted to discover automated tools that analyse heart sounds by applying machine learning algorithms. Although tremendous efforts have been made in this area, no successful framework currently exists to detect pathology in signals because of issues with background noise or poor quality. One part of the evolution of machine learning is the development of deep learning networks, which are designed to exploit the compositional structure of data. This paper investigates the performance of a convolutional neural network called AlexNet, focusing on two approaches for distinguishing abnormality in PCG signals with data collected from the 2016 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge dataset. This dataset contains heart sound recordings collected from clinical and non-clinical environments. Our extensive simulation results indicated that using AlexNet as feature extractor and Support Vector Machine as classifier a 87% recognition accuracy was achieved, this is an improvement of 85% accuracy obtained by end-to-end learning AlexNet in comparison to the benchmarked techniques. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;AlexNet--Classification--Convolutional neural network--End-to-end learning--Feature extraction--PCG;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Convolution--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Feature extraction--Heart--Intelligent computing--Learning algorithms--Machine learning--Neural networks--Phonocardiography--Support vector machines--AlexNet--Clinical environments--Compositional structure--Convolutional neural network--Detection and diagnosis--End to end--Extensive simulations--Recognition accuracy--Biomedical signal processing;Springer Verlag;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85070720833

Heart diseases have caused death irrespective of age, gender or any other demographics. Its diagnosis is, hence, very significant, and angiography is used most commonly for the stated purpose, but it is very expensive and causes side effects. Machine learning techniques are used for diagnosing heart diseases. This study utilizes Z-Alizadeh Sani heart disease dataset for experimenting four feature selection and four optimization techniques to improve the performance of a standard neural network. The experimentation has helped us in finalizing the proposed technique, and the final technique has also been applied on two other datasets in order to ensure that overfitting is avoided. The results of the final application are promising, and in the future, we intend to form a subset of those features which are selected by all the techniques. We also intend to make an ensemble of the best weight optimization techniques in order to further improve the standard neural network. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.;Classification--Decision support system--Deep learning--Feature selection--Healthcare--Heart disease--Heart failure--Machine learning--Neural network--Weight optimization;Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Decision support systems--Deep learning--Deep neural networks--Diagnosis--Diseases--Feature extraction--Health care--Heart--Intelligent systems--Learning systems--Machine learning--Neural networks--Heart disease--Heart disease diagnosis--Heart failure--Machine learning techniques--Optimization techniques--Overfitting--Standard neural--Weight optimization--Artificial heart;Springer Verlag;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85072819998

Moreover, rule-based expert systems are inefficient in solving complicated medical tasks or for creating insights using big data. Deep learning has emerged as a more accurate and effective technology in a wide range of medical problems such as diagnosis, prediction, and intervention. Deep learning is a representation learning method that consists of layers that transform data nonlinearly, thus, revealing hierarchical relationships and structures. In this review, we survey deep learning application papers that use structured data, and signal and imaging modalities from cardiology. We discuss the advantages and limitations of applying deep learning in cardiology that also apply in medicine in general, while proposing certain directions as the most viable for clinical use. © 2008 IEEE.;cardiology--cardiovascular disease--Deep learning--neural networks;Big Data--Cardiology--Deep Learning--Heart Diseases--Humans--Machine Learning--Physicians--Big data--Cardiology--Computer aided instruction--Diagnosis--Expert systems--Mathematical transformations--Medical problems--Neural networks--Cardio-vascular disease--Clinical use--Imaging modality--Large amounts--Learning methods--Medical fields--Rule based expert systems--Structured data--algorithm--Article--artificial neural network--bleeding--cardiology--cardiovascular disease--computer assisted tomography--data base--deep learning--diagnostic procedure--echocardiography--electrocardiogram--heart arrhythmia--heart left ventricle--human--image segmentation--intravascular ultrasound--microaneurysm--nuclear magnetic resonance imaging--optical coherence tomography--oscillometry--perceptron--phonocardiography--photography--cardiology--diagnostic imaging--heart disease--machine learning--pathophysiology--physician--procedures--trends--Deep learning;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers;30530339;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85058143910

This paper proposes a sample expansion-oriented LDBN heart disease risk forecast model, in order to solve the following problems: the difficulty of related medical data acquisition in heart disease diagnosis, less samples, the slow convergence speeds and easily caught in the local optimum of existing risk forecast models. Starting from LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) that forecast the information of the next moment with extract knowledge from existing information and combined with the current moment input information or the previous layer output information of DNN (Deep Neural Networks), the model simulates the information of patients with heart disease and adopts the corresponding strategies to expand medical data about heart disease. Then, we build a risk forecast model based on LDBN (Long Deep Belief Networks) for more accurate prediction combing with DBN (Deep Belief Network) and the improved recurrent neural Network(Long Short Term Memory), and use Heart Disease Databases of UCI to verify the accuracy of the model.

In many practical applications, the hyperparameter tuning directly affects the accuracy. Therefore, the tuning optimization of hyperparameters is an important topic. At present, hyperparameters can only be set manually based on experience, and use Violent Enumeration, Random Search or through Grid Search to try and error, lack of effective automatic search parameters. In this study, we proposed a machine learning hyperparameter fine tuning service on dynamic cloud resource allocation system, which leverages several mainstream hyperparameter tuning methods such as Hyperopt and Optunity. In the meanwhile, various tuning methods are measured and compared by example application in this work. Finally, we dedicated actual case - Heart Sounds, and then tested it. In order to verify that the system service can not only automate the task of tuning, but also break through the limitation of the number of adjustable parameters. Furthermore the proposed hyperparameter fine tune system makes optimization process more efficient. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.;Grid Search--Hyperopt--Hyperparameters--Optunity--Random Search;Big data--Cardiology--Machine learning--Optimization--Resource allocation--Grid search--Hyperopt--Hyperparameters--Optunity--Random searches--Deep learning;Association for Computing Machinery;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85061927974

A majority of patients who suffer from sepsis are not diagnosed at the time of admission. Early detection and antibiotic treatment of sepsis are vital to improve outcomes for these patients, as each hour of delayed treatment is associated with increased mortality. In this study our goal is to predict sepsis 12 hours before its diagnosis using vitals and blood tests routinely taken in the ICU. We have investigated the performance of several machine learning algorithms including XGBoost, CNN, CNN-LSTM and CNN-XGBoost. Contrary to our expectations, XGBoost outperforms all of the sequential models and yields the best hour-by-hour prediction, perhaps due to the way we imputed missing values, losing signal that relates to the time-series nature of the EHR data. We added feature engineering to detect change points in tests and vitals, resulting in 5% improvement in XGBoost. Our team, USF-Sepsis-Phys, achieved a utility score of 0.22 (untuned threshold) and an average of the three reported AUCs (test sets A, B, C) of 0.82. As expected with this AUC, the same model with tuned threshold (not run in the PhysioNet challenge) performed significantly better, as evaluated with 3-fold cross-validation of the entire PhyisoNet training set. © 2019 Creative Commons.;;Cardiology--Codes (symbols)--Diagnosis--Forecasting--Learning algorithms--Long short-term memory--Patient treatment--Time series--Antibiotic treatment--Change-points--Cross validation--Feature engineerings--Health condition--Missing values--Sequential model--Training sets--Deep learning;IEEE Computer Society;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85081117555

Thus, the healthcare industry is trying to gather a large amount of CVD information, which can help the doctors to detect and identify the potential risk factors of the CVD. Deep learning can dig out the hidden pattern of the disease and symptoms from this structured and unstructured medical information. As a result, in this paper, we propose an algorithm to predict the risk factors of the CVD using the attention module based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which has almost 95% accuracy and 0.90 Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) scores--better than any other previously proposed methods. Moreover, we propose a novel Intelligent Healthcare Platform for continuous data collection and patient monitoring system. Initially, the proposed platform is used for data collection, and we find out the best suitable features from the dataset for applying various machine learning algorithms. The experimental results show that the attention module based LSTM outperforms than the other statistical machine learning algorithms for the prediction as well as indicates significant risk factors of the CVD, which can be supportive for the CVD patients to change their lifestyle. © 2019 IEEE.;big data--cardiovascular disease--CVD risk factors--deep learning--LSTM;Big data--Cardiology--Data acquisition--Deep learning--Diseases--Forecasting--Health care--Long short-term memory--Machine learning--Patient monitoring--Cardio-vascular disease--Cardio-vascular disease risk factors--Continuous data collections--Correlation coefficient--LSTM--Patient monitoring systems--Risk factors--Statistical machine learning--Learning algorithms;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85073201541

The major utilization of ML is to predict the conclusion established on the extant data. Using an established dataset machine determine emulate and spread them to an unfamiliar data sets to anticipate the conclusion. A few classification algorithm's accuracy prediction is satisfactory, although other perform limited accuracy. Different ML and Deep Learning (DL) networks established on ANN have been extensively recommended for the disclosure of heart disease in antecedent researches. In this paper, we used UCI Heart Disease dataset to test ML techniques along with conventional methods (i.e. random forest, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor), as well as deep learning models (i.e. long short-term-memory and gated-recurrent unit neural networks). To improve the accuracy of weak algorithms we explore voting based model by combining multiple classifiers. A provisional cogent approach was used to regulate how the ensemble technique can be enforced to improve an accuracy in the heart disease prediction. The strength of the proposed ensemble approach such as voting based model is compelling in improving the prognosis accuracy of anemic classifiers and established adequate achievement in analyze risk of heart disease. A superlative increase of 2.1% accuracy for anemic classifiers was attained with the help of an ensemble voting based model. © 2020, Science and Information Organization.;Deep learning--Heart disease--Irvine (UCI) dataset--Machine learning--Majority voting ensemble--University of california;Cardiology--Decision trees--Diagnosis--Diseases--Nearest neighbor search--Recurrent neural networks--Statistical tests--Support vector machines--Data set--Deep learning--Heart disease--Irvine (UCI) dataset--Machine learning techniques--Machine-learning--Majority voting ensemble--Neural network's ensemble--University of California--Voting method--Forecasting;Science and Information Organization;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85083165149

On other hand, non-invoice based techniques are more effective for heart disease diagnosis. Therefore, we check the capability of various Machine Learning (ML) classifiers and deep learning classifier for heart disease identification in this paper. Six machine-learning classifiers and BPNN were used in order to check which one classifier is more effective for diagnosis the heart disease. The feature selection algorithm Relief was used for selection of important features and on these selected features, classifiers performances were also computed. Ensemble machine learning techniques (boosting, bagging, stacking) were used to further increase the classifiers performance. Furthermore, cross-validation techniques k-folds was also used. Additionally backward propagation neural network (BPNN) was also used for classification purpose because deep learning algorithm not need feature selection algorithms and it automatically select important features for good result. Based on model performance evaluation metrics the SVM (RBF) performed excellently on full features achieved accuracy 86%, and 88% accuracy on selected features as compared other classifiers. Through Ensemble learning techniques, SVM obtained the classification accuracy 92.30%. The BPNN achieved 93% classification accuracy. Thus the performance of deep neural networks learning algorithm is better than traditional machine learning algorithms. As per our experimental results shows that the performance of BPNN based diagnosis system is more effective for heart disease diagnosis. © 2019 IEEE.;Accuracy--Decision support system--Features selection--Heart Disease--Machine learning;Adaptive boosting--Backpropagation--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Computer aided diagnosis--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Feature extraction--Heart--Learning systems--Research laboratories--Silicon compounds--Support vector machines--Backward propagation neural networks--Classification accuracy--Cross-validation technique--Feature selection algorithm--Heart disease diagnosis--Machine learning techniques--Model performance evaluations--Predictive capabilities--Deep learning;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85084311229

Among the large number of heart diseases, cardiac arrhythmias are a group of conditions where the heartbeat is irregular, and it can predispose a person to have a stroke or heart failure. Doctors use the electrocardiogram (ECG) taken from the patient to diagnose the presence of a particular arrhythmia condition, usually by means of manually analyzing and interpreting the comprising waves.This paper presents a proposal to design a tool for detection of cardiac arrhythmias based on ECG data, using supervised learning techniques found on the Python machine learning library called PyTorch, and using publicly available processed ECG parameters from the UCI Arrhythmia Data Set as input for training and verification of our neural network based model. Tool detection accuracy using 450 samples for training achieved around 85 % of correct answers.Additionally, this tool was designed as an assistant tool for aiding doctors to better diagnose these kind of conditions, taking into account a ease-to-use interface.

Most of the researches have been focusing on prediction algorithms of patients' diseases such as cancer, cardiology, breast pathology, etc. Some findings increased computer intelligence as the main application of AI which called deep or non-deep machine learning. The gap from previous models is using one function or one type of AI to analyze, forecast diseases rather than helping patients and doctors in surgery. There are rarely white papers using AI for patients approach to training them to know more about their diseases or surgery. Therefore, with developing of more than one function of AI, the paper builds a diagrammatic conceptual model of artificial intelligence on medical app running Blockchain technology as a friendly assistant for both patients and doctors to communicate them during pre-surgery, surgery and post-surgery. First, AI as an assistant checks free appointment from doctors and patients' available time. Second, AI reminds doctors' schedule of upcoming surgery list and training patients before taking surgery. Third, deep learning AI analyses patients' healthcare record and suggesting the solutions for patients after surgery under the doctor's review. This paper hopefully will contribute to AI application in healthcare in which not only doctors using it but also patients, drug companies, insurance companies and hospitals can approach. © 2019 PICMET.;;Deep learning--Insurance--Intelligent systems--Machine learning--Surgery--AI applications--Breast pathology--Computer intelligences--Conceptual model--Healthcare record--Insurance companies--Prediction algorithms--Robotics industry--Medical computing;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85075632314

Rapid advancements led to the availability of technology which could predict many different diseases risks. Patients Electronic Health Records (EHR) contains all different kinds of medical data for each patient, for each medical visit. Now there are many predictive models like random forests, boosted trees which provide high accuracy but not end-to-end interpretability while the ones such as Naive-Bayes, logistic regression and single decision trees are intelligible enough but less accurate. These models are interpretable but they lack to see the temporal relationships in the characteristic attributes present in the EHR data. Eventually, the model accuracy is compromised. Interpretability of a model is essential in critical healthcare applications. Interpretability helps the medical personnel with explanations that build trust towards machine learning systems. This chapter contains the design and implementation of an Explainable Deep Learning System for Healthcare using EHR. In this chapter, use of an attention mechanism and Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) on EHR data has been discussed, for predicting heart failure of patients and providing insight into the key diagnoses that have led to the prediction. The patient’s medical history is given as a sequential input to the RNN which predicts the heart failure risk and provides explainability along with it. This represents an ante-hoc explainability model. A neural network having two levels and attention model is trained for detecting those visits of the patient in his history that could be influential and significant to understand the reasons behind any prediction done on the medical history of the patient data. Thus, considering the last visit first proves to be beneficial. When a prediction is made, the visit-level contribution is prioritized i.e. which visit contributes the most to the final prediction where each visit consists of multiple codes. This model can be helpful to medical persons for predicting the heart failure risks of patients with diseases they have been diagnosed with based on EHR. This model is then worked upon by local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) which provide the different features that positively and negatively contribute to heart failure risk. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Attention--Deep learning--Explainability--Heart failure--Interpretability--LIME--Predictive modeling--RNN;Cardiology--Decision trees--Diagnosis--Forestry--Health care--Heart--Hospital data processing--Learning systems--Lime--Recurrent neural networks--Attention--Deep learning--Electronic health--Explainability--Failure risk--Health records--Heart failure--Interpretability--Local interpretable model-agnostic explanation--Predictive models--Forecasting;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;;Book chapter;Scopus;2-s2.0-85089778356

This mutation results in impaired cardiac sodium channel function and is associated with increased ventricular arrhythmogenic risk which can result in sudden cardiac death. Lead I and Lead II ECG signals from wild-type and Scn5a+/- mice are used and the mice are also grouped as female/male and young/old.We use our novel Symmetric Projection Attractor Reconstruction (SPAR) method to generate an attractor from the ECG signal using all of the available waveform data. We have previously manually extracted a variety of quantitative measures from the attractor and used machine learning to classify each animal as either wild-type or mutant. In this work, we take the attractor images and use these as input to a deep learning algorithm in order to perform the same classification. As there is only data available from 42 mice, we use a transfer learning approach in which a network that has been pretrained on millions of images is used as a starting point and the last few layers are changed in order to fine tune the network for the attractor images.The results for the transfer learning approach are not as good as for the manual features, which is not too surprising as the networks have not been trained on attractor images. However, this approach shows the potential for using deep learning for classification of attractor images. © 2019 Creative Commons.;;Biomedical signal processing--Cardiology--Electrocardiography--Lead compounds--Learning algorithms--Mammals--Transfer learning--Attractor reconstruction--Genetic mutations--Mutant mice--Mutation results--Quantitative measures--Sodium channel functions--Sudden cardiac deaths--Waveform data--Deep learning;IEEE Computer Society;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85081128393

Recent Findings: The term “deep learning” has been applied to a subset of machine learning that utilizes a “neural network” and is often used interchangeably with “artificial intelligence.” It has been increasingly utilized in healthcare for computational “learning”, especially for pattern recognition for diagnostic imaging. Another promising application is the potential for these neural networks to improve the accuracy in the identification of patients who are at risk for cardiovascular events and could benefit most from preventive treatment in comparison with more conventional statistical techniques. The importance of such tailored cardiovascular risk assessment and disease management in individual patients is far reaching given that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. Nearly half of myocardial infarctions and strokes occur in patients who are not predicted to be at risk for cardiovascular events by current guideline-based approaches. Equally important are individuals who are not at risk for cardiovascular events and yet are given expensive and unnecessary preventive treatment with potential untoward side effects. Summary: The application of powerful artificial intelligence/deep learning tools in medicine is likely to result in more effective and efficient health care delivery with the potential for significant cost savings by shifting preventative treatment from inappropriate to appropriate patient subgroups. © 2018, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US--foreign copyright protection may apply.;Artificial intelligence--Big data--Cardiac imaging--Convolutional neural networks--Electronic health records--Machine learning--Neural networks;Artificial Intelligence--Cardiac Imaging Techniques--Cardiology--Cardiovascular Diseases--Deep Learning--Humans--Machine Learning--Neural Networks (Computer)--artificial intelligence--cancer mortality--cardiac imaging--cardiovascular disease--cerebrovascular accident--diagnostic accuracy--diagnostic imaging--disease management--electronic health record--heart infarction--human--image analysis--machine learning--mathematical computing--medicine--morbidity--nerve cell network--outcome assessment--patient risk--prediction--preventive medicine--Review--risk assessment--artificial intelligence--artificial neural network--cardiac imaging--cardiology--diagnostic imaging--machine learning;Current Medicine Group LLC 1;30334108;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85055079845

How to predict and therefore prevent readmission has been a significant challenge in outcomes research. To address this, we propose a deep learning approach to predict readmission from clinical notes. Unlike conventional methods that use structured data for prediction, we leverage the unstructured clinical notes to train deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). We then use the trained models to classify and predict potentially high-risk admissions/patients. For evaluation, we trained CNNs using the discharge summary notes in the MIMIC III database. We also trained regular machine learning models based on random forest using the same datasets. The result shows that deep learning models outperform the regular models in prediction tasks. CNN method achieves a F1 score of 0.756 in general readmission prediction and 0.733 in 30-day readmission prediction, while random forest only achieves a F1 score of 0.674 and 0.656 respectively. We also propose a chi-square test based method to interpret key features associated with deep learning predicted readmissions. It reveals clinical insights about readmission embedded in the clinical notes. Collectively, our method can make the human evaluation process more efficient and potentially facilitate the reduction of readmission rates. © 2019 IEEE.;clinical notes mining--deep learning--electronic health records--natural language processing--readmission prediction;Bioinformatics--Cardiology--Convolutional neural networks--Decision trees--Failure (mechanical)--Forecasting--Learning systems--Random forests--Statistical tests--Chi-square tests--Conventional methods--Discharge summary--Human evaluation--Learning approach--Machine learning models--Outcomes research--Prediction tasks--Deep learning;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85084329674

To satisfy their demand for sample size, the most commonly used method for data augmentation is that which divides each heart sound instance into a number of segments, with each segment labelled as the same category as its origin and used as a new sample for training or forecasting. However, performing this poses a crucial issue as to how to determine the category of a predicted heart sound instance from its segments' prediction results. Approach: To solve this issue, this paper establishes a mathematical formula to connect the classification performance of these heart sound instances with the prediction results of their segments via a threshold which is supervised by the training set. The optimal value of the proposed threshold is calculated by maximizing the prediction accuracy of the training instances. Seeking the optimal threshold by a gradient-based method, we prove that a continuous function can closely approximate a part of the function of accuracy which transforms the discrete function of accuracy into a continuous function. The optimal threshold is used to recognize the undetermined heart sound recording. Main results: Experimental results show the classification performance from a 10-fold cross-validation, measured by the commonly used scales of sensitivity, specificity and mean accuracy (MAcc). The proposed algorithm improves the MAcc by about 4% by modifying the baseline. In addition, the MAcc surpasses the champion of the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2016. Significance: Our study develops a methodology to determine the category of a predicted heart sound instance from its segments' prediction results, thus assisting in the data augmentation exercise which is necessary to provide sufficient data for deep classification networks. Our method significantly improves the classification performance. © 2018 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.;deep neural network--heart sound classification--heart sound segmentation--supervised threshold;Heart Sounds--Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted--Supervised Machine Learning--Audio recordings--Classification (of information)--Deep neural networks--Forecasting--Functions--Heart--Classification networks--Classification performance--Deep classifications--Heart sound classification--Heart sound segmentation--Heart sounds--Sound classification--Sound segmentation--Supervised threshold--heart sound--signal processing--supervised machine learning--Cardiology;IOP Publishing Ltd;30500785;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85057725866

Predictive models based on personal health information have been developed historically by using simple regression fitting over relatively few factors. Regression approaches have been favored in previous prediction modeling approaches because they are simplest and do not assume any non-linearity in the model for contributions of the chosen factors. In practice, many factors are correlated and have underlying non-linear relationships to the predicted outcome. Deep learning offers a means to construct a more complex modeling approach, along with automation and adaptation. The aim of this paper is to assess the ability of a deep learning model to predict the heart disease incidence using a common benchmark dataset (University of California, Irvine (UCI) dataset). The performance of deep learning model has been compared with four popular machine learning models (two linear and two nonlinear) in predicting the incidence of heart disease using data from 567 participants from two cohorts taken from UCI database. The deep learning model was able to achieve the best accuracy of 94% and an AUC score of 0.964 when compared to other models. The performance of deep learning and nonlinear machine learning models was significantly better compared to the linear machine learning models with increase in the dataset size. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Cardiovascular disease--Deep learning--Machine learning--Risk factors--Risk prediction;Biomedical engineering--Cardiology--Computer aided instruction--Diagnosis--Diseases--Forecasting--Learning systems--Machine learning--Medical computing--Medical imaging--Stents--Cardio-vascular disease--Machine learning models--Non-linear relationships--Personal health informations--Regression fitting--Risk factors--Risk predictions--University of California--Deep learning;Springer;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85075717317

Furthermore, computation workstations suited for deep learning are usually equipped with multiple GPUs allowing for workload distribution among multiple GPUs for larger datasets while exploiting parallelism in each GPU. In this paper, we utilize distributed and parallel computation techniques to efficiently analyze healthcare data using deep learning techniques. We demonstrate the scalability and computational benefits of this approach with a case study of longitudinal assessment of approximately 150 000 type 2 diabetic patients. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the fourth case of mortality worldwide with rising prevalence. T2DM leads to adverse events such as acute myocardial infarction, major amputations, and avoidable hospitalizations. This paper aims to establish a relation between laboratory and medical assessment variables with the occurrence of the aforementioned adverse events and its prediction using machine learning techniques. We use a raw database provided by Basque Health Service, Spain, to conduct this study. This database contains 150 156 patients diagnosed with T2DM, from whom 321 laboratory and medical assessment variables recorded over four years are available. Predictions of adverse events on T2DM patients using both classical machine learning and deep learning techniques were performed and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score as metrics. The best performance for the prediction of acute myocardial infarction is obtained by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machines (SVM) both balanced and weight models with an accuracy of 97%--hospital admission for avoidable causes best performance is obtained by LDA balanced and SVMs balanced both with an accuracy of 92%. For the prediction of the incidence of at least one adverse event, the model with the best performance is the recurrent neural network trained with a balanced dataset with an accuracy of 94.6%. The ability to perform and compare these experiments was possible through the use of a workstation with multi-GPUs. This setup allows for scalability to larger datasets. Such models are also cloud ready and can be deployed on similar architectures hosted on AWS for even larger datasets. © 2005-2012 IEEE.;Deep learning--graphics processing unit (GPU) computing--healthcare;Cardiology--Computer graphics--Computer graphics equipment--Discriminant analysis--Forecasting--Graphics processing unit--Health care--Image coding--Learning algorithms--Machine learning--Patient monitoring--Program processors--Recurrent neural networks--Scalability--Support vector machines--Acute myocardial infarction--Healthcare data analysis--Learning techniques--Linear discriminant analysis--Machine learning techniques--Parallel Computation--Type 2 diabetes mellitus--Work-load distribution--Deep learning;IEEE Computer Society;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85073606013

Most of the current work in the literature are either rule-based methods, requiring prior knowledge of arrhythmia analysis to build rules, or classical machine learning approaches, depending on hand-engineered features. In this work, we apply convolutional neural networks to automatically extract time-invariant features, an attention mechanism to put more emphasis on the important regions of the segmented input signal(s) that are more likely to contribute to an alarm, and long short-term memory units to capture the temporal information presented in the signal segments. We trained our method efficiently using a twostep training algorithm (i.e., pre-training and fine-tuning the proposed network) on the dataset provided by the PhysioNet computing in cardiology challenge 2015. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method obtains better results compared to other existing algorithms for the false alarm reduction task in ICUs. The proposed method achieves a sensitivity of 93.88% and a specificity of 92.05% for the alarm classification, considering three different signals. In addition, our experiments for 5 separate alarm types leads significant results, where we just consider a single-lead ECG (e.g., a sensitivity of 90.71%, a specificity of 88.30%, an AUC of 89.51 for alarm type of Ventricular Tachycardia arrhythmia). © 2020 Mousavi et al.

Schmidt College of Medicine, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL, United States;The practice of medicine is changing with the development of new Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods of machine learning. Coupled with rapid improvements in computer processing, these AI-based systems are already improving the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis and treatment across various specializations. The increasing focus of AI in radiology has led to some experts suggesting that someday AI may even replace radiologists. These suggestions raise the question of whether AI-based systems will eventually replace physicians in some specializations or will augment the role of physicians without actually replacing them. To assess the impact on physicians this research seeks to better understand this technology and how it is transforming medicine. To that end this paper researches the role of AI-based systems in performing medical work in specializations including radiology, pathology, ophthalmology, and cardiology. It concludes that AI-based systems will augment physicians and are unlikely to replace the traditional physician–patient relationship.

The dataset consists of 1,985 patients monitored at an MGH sleep laboratory where vital signs were recorded, and arousal regions were annotated by experts. This work presents a deep-learning method to identify sleep arousals. In traditional machine learning, feature extraction is one of the most time-intensive considerations, requiring a great deal of domain expertise and experimentation. In contrast, deep learning techniques automatically learn variable interactions between pairs or groups of signals, and any relevant temporal dependencies. This allows such algorithms to automatically extract sleep patterns from rich physiological time series. The model presented here integrates ideas from several successful deep learning models to construct a multi-channel time-series convolutional-deconvolutional neural network. This network was trained using crossentropy loss, and evaluated on a 20% held-out validation set. Hyper-parameters were selected on the AUPRC metric, and training utilized early stopping to prevent overfitting. The resultant model achieved an AUPRC of 0.369 and an AUROC of 0.855 on the final competition test set. © 2018 Creative Commons Attribution.;;Cardiology--Diagnosis--Physiology--Sleep research--Time series--Competition tests--Domain expertise--Learning methods--Learning models--Learning techniques--Physical health--Sleep laboratories--Variable interaction--Deep learning;IEEE Computer Society;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85068791589

The motive of this paper is to demonstrate that the reliable S1 and S2 classification performances based on the combinatory feature (CF) derived from higher order moments and cepstral-based domain can still be achieved, under the circumstances where the timing interval information might not be easily understood due to cardiac abnormalities. Using deep neural networks approach, a stacked autoencoder (SAE) based on the CF is proposed for the classification of fundamental HSs. Experiments are conducted on both publicly available and recorded HSs signals for the validation of the proposed method. The SAE using the proposed CF achieves better classification results in recognizing S1 and S2 in comparison to well-known classifiers such as deep belief neural network, support vector machine, Naive Bayes, linear discriminant analysis, and boosting ensemble. The proposed method shows higher classification rate in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity by considering CF, which uses Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and its derivative features. A second approach for addressing the problem of S1 and S2 identifications is carried out by employing 1-D convolutional neural network that uses the signals directly to learn the relevant features by its own for the recognition. © 2018 IEEE.

Previous de-identification tasks focused on non-German medical texts, which raised the demand for an in-depth evaluation of de-identification methods on German medical texts. Because of remarkable advancements in natural language processing using supervised machine learning methods on limited training data, we evaluated them for the first time on German medical reports using our annotated data set consisting of 113 medical reports from the cardiology domain. We applied state-of-the-art deep learning methods using pre-trained models as input to a bidirectional LSTM network and well-established conditional random fields for de-identification of German medical reports. We performed an extensive evaluation for de-identification and multiclass named entity recognition. Using rule based and out of domain machine learning methods as a baseline, the conditional random field improved F2-score from 70 to 93% for de-identification, the neural approach reached 96% in F2-score while keeping balanced precision and recall rates. These results show, that state-of-the-art machine learning methods can play a crucial role in de-identification of German medical reports. © 2019 The authors and IOS Press.;De-identification--Deep learning--ELMo--German medical admission notes--LSTM--Machine learning--Personal health information;Data Anonymization--Deep Learning--Electronic Health Records--Machine Learning--Natural Language Processing--Image segmentation--Learning algorithms--Learning systems--Long short-term memory--Medical informatics--Natural language processing systems--Random processes--Supervised learning--Text processing--De-identification--ELMo--German medical admission notes--LSTM--Personal health informations--cardiology--conference paper--deep learning--long short term memory network--medical information--natural language processing--recall--supervised machine learning--anonymization--electronic health record--machine learning--Deep learning;IOS Press;31483261;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85071762811

In particular, medical imaging requires very precise, accurate and fine recognition power. Numerous works in the literature have reported promising prospects of CNN applied in prognosis and radiology diagnosis. A common goal among those works, largely is to try achieving a most accurate deep learning model in analysing the insights from the finest details of the medical imaging. To this end, a novel machine learning model that is equipped with multi-view data-preprocessing and swarm-based hyperparameter optimization is proposed. The former is for provi ding additional training data in the hope that salient features could discovered--the latter is for finding the most optimal set of model parameters for the CNN. They both serve only one purpose-to enhance the object recognition power to the highest possible.

Detecting abnormal heart sounds by algorithms is important for remote health monitoring and other scenarios where having an experienced physician is not possible. While several studies exist, we explore the possibility of detecting anomalies in heart sounds and murmurs using Deep-learning algorithms on well-known Physionet Dataset. We performed the experiments by employing various algorithms such as RNN, LSTM, GRU, B-RNN, B-LSTM and CNN.

However, most of these techniques focus on the preprocessing of features only. In this paper, we focus on both, i.e., refinement of features and elimination of the problems posed by the predictive model, i.e., the problems of underfitting and overfitting. By avoiding the model from overfitting and underfitting, it can show good performance on both the datasets, i.e., training data and testing data. Inappropriate network configuration and irrelevant features often result in overfitting the training data. To eliminate irrelevant features, we propose to use χ2 statistical model while the optimally configured deep neural network (DNN) is searched by using exhaustive search strategy. The strength of the proposed hybrid model named χ2 -DNN is evaluated by comparing its performance with conventional ANN and DNN models, another state of the art machine learning models and previously reported methods for heart disease prediction. The proposed model achieves the prediction accuracy of 93.33%. The obtained results are promising compared to the previously reported methods. The findings of the study suggest that the proposed diagnostic system can be used by physicians to accurately predict heart disease. © 2013 IEEE.;Deep neural network--heart disease--hyperparameters optimization--overfitting--underfitting;Artificial heart--Cardiology--Decision support systems--Diagnosis--Diseases--Forecasting--Heart--Neural networks--Automated diagnostic systems--Heart disease--Hyperparameters--Machine learning models--Network configuration--Overfitting--Statistical modeling--underfitting--Deep neural networks;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85063877494

Current clinical methods remain subject to potential high-risk, nonreproducibility and time-consumption issues. In this study, a deep spatiotemporal adversarial network (DSTGAN) is proposed as a contrast-free, stable and automatic clinical tool to simultaneously segment and quantify MIs directly from the cine MR image. The DSTGAN is implemented using a conditional generative model, which conditions the distributions of the objective cine MR image to directly optimize the generalized error of the mapping between the input and the output. The method consists of the following: (1) A multi-level and multi-scale spatiotemporal variation encoder learns a coarse to fine hierarchical feature to effectively encode the MI-specific morphological and kinematic abnormality structures, which vary for different spatial locations and time periods. (2) The top-down and cross-task generators learn the shared representations between segmentation and quantification to use the commonalities and differences between the two related tasks and enhance the generator preference. (3) Three inter-/intra-tasks to label the relatedness discriminators are iteratively imposed on the encoder and generator to detect and correct the inconsistencies in the label relatedness between and within tasks via adversarial learning. Our proposed method yields a pixel classification accuracy of 96.98%, and the mean absolute error of the MI centroid is 0.96 mm from 165 clinical subjects. These results indicate the potential of our proposed method in aiding standardized MI assessments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.;Full quantification--Generative adversarial networks--Myocardial infarction--Segmentation--Sequential images;Humans--Image Enhancement--Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted--Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine--Myocardial Infarction--Neural Networks, Computer--Cardiology--Diagnosis--Iterative methods--Magnetic resonance imaging--Signal encoding--gadolinium pentetate meglumine--Adversarial networks--Full quantification--Hierarchical features--Myocardial Infarction--Pixel classification--Sequential images--Shared representations--Spatio-temporal variation--Article--cardiac muscle--deep spatiotemporal adversarial network--feature extraction--heart infarction size--human--image analysis--image segmentation--machine learning--major clinical study--nuclear magnetic resonance imaging--observational study--priority journal--retrospective study--ST segment elevation myocardial infarction--cine magnetic resonance imaging--computer assisted diagnosis--diagnostic imaging--heart infarction--image enhancement--procedures--Image segmentation;Elsevier B.V.;31622838;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85073152444

Predicting the readmission rate early one can alleviate the financial and medical consequences. Most related studies only select the patient’s structural features or text features for modeling analysis, which offer an incomplete picture of the patient. Based on structured data (including demographic data, clinical data, administrative data) and medical record text, this paper uses deep learning methods to construct an optimal model for hospital readmission prediction, tested on a dataset of heart disease patients’ 30-day readmission. The results show that when only structured data is used, the deep learning model is much better than the Naive Bayes model and slightly better than the Support Vector Machine model. Adding a text model to the deep learning model improves performance, increasing accuracy and F1-score by 2% and 6%, respectively. This indicates that textual information contributes greatly to hospital readmission predictions. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Deep learning--Hospital readmission--Predictive analytics;Bayesian networks--Cardiology--Diseases--Forecasting--Hospitals--Predictive analytics--Support vector machines--Demographic data--Health-care system--Learning approach--Learning methods--Naive Bayes models--Structural feature--Support vector machine models--Textual information--Deep learning;Springer;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85076748322

However, medical imaging presents uniquely pertinent obstacles such as a lack of accessible data or a high-cost of annotation. To address this, we developed data-efficient deep learning classifiers for prediction tasks in cardiology. Using pipeline supervised models to focus relevant structures, we achieve an accuracy of 94.4% for 15-view still-image echocardiographic view classification and 91.2% accuracy for binary left ventricular hypertrophy classification. We then develop semi-supervised generative adversarial network models that can learn from both labeled and unlabeled data in a generalizable fashion. We achieve greater than 80% accuracy in view classification with only 4% of labeled data used in solely supervised techniques and achieve 92.3% accuracy for left ventricular hypertrophy classification. In exploring trade-offs between model type, resolution, data resources, and performance, we present a comprehensive analysis and improvements of efficient deep learning solutions for medical imaging assessment especially in cardiology. © 2018, The Author(s).;;Classification (of information)--Deep learning--Echocardiography--Economic and social effects--Generative adversarial networks--Medical imaging--Pathology--Automated diagnosis--Automated interpretation--Cardiac disease--Computer vision algorithms--High costs--Highly accurate--Learning classifiers--Left ventricular hypertrophies--Prediction tasks--Semi-supervised--accuracy--algorithm--Article--automation--classification--classifier--echocardiography--heart disease--heart left ventricle hypertrophy--image segmentation--priority journal--supervised machine learning--Cardiology;Nature Publishing Group;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85135598377

The focus is on patient screening and identifying patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), which represents a life threatening cardiac arrhythmia. The proposed approach operates with a large volume of raw ECG time-series data as inputs to a deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). It autonomously learns representative and key features of the PAF to be used by a classification module. The features are therefore learned directly from the large time domain ECG signals by using a CNN with one fully connected layer. The learned features can effectively replace the traditional ad hoc and time-consuming user's hand-crafted features. Our experimental results verify and validate the effectiveness and capabilities of the learned features for PAF patient screening. The main advantages of our proposed approach are to simplify the feature extraction process corresponding to different cardiac arrhythmias and to remove the need for using a human expert to define appropriate and critical features working with a large time-series data set. The extensive simulations and case studies conducted indicate that combining the learned features with other classifiers will significantly improve the performance of the patient screening system as compared to an end-to-end CNN classifier. The effectiveness and capabilities of our proposed ECG DL classification machine is demonstrated and quantitative comparisons with several conventional machine learning classifiers are also provided. © 2013 IEEE.;Biomedical monitoring--deep convolution neural network--electrocardiogram (ECG)--feature extraction--neural network architecture--paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF);Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Convolution--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Extraction--Feature extraction--Hidden Markov models--Monitoring--Network architecture--Neural networks--Time series--Biomedical monitoring--Convolution neural network--Deep convolutional neural networks--Electrocardiogram signal classifications--Fully-connected layers--Medical services--Paroxysmal atrial fibrillations--Quantitative comparison--Biomedical signal processing;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85020407619

The present study describes the development and clinical applications of a large database of such digital ECGs, namely the CODE (Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiology) study. ECGs obtained by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais, Brazil, from 2010 to 17, were organized in a structured database. A hierarchical free-text machine learning algorithm recognized specific ECG diagnoses from cardiologist reports. The Glasgow ECG Analysis Program provided Minnesota Codes and automatic diagnostic statements. The presence of a specific ECG abnormality was considered when both automatic and medical diagnosis were concordant--cases of discordance were decided using heuristisc rules and manual review. The ECG database was linked to the national mortality information system using probabilistic linkage methods. From 2,470,424 ECGs, 1,773,689 patients were identified. After excluding the ECGs with technical problems and patients <16 years-old, 1,558,415 patients were studied. High performance measures were obtained using an end-to-end deep neural network trained to detect 6 types of ECG abnormalities, with F1 scores >80% and specificity >99% in an independent test dataset. We also evaluated the risk of mortality associated with the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF), which showed that AF was a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality and mortality for all causes, with increased risk in women. In conclusion, a large database that comprises all ECGs performed by a large telehealth network can be useful for further developments in the field of digital electrocardiography, clinical cardiology and cardiovascular epidemiology. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.;Artificial intelligence--Big-data--Electrocardiography--Telehealth;Adolescent--Atrial Fibrillation--Brazil--Electrocardiography--Female--Humans--Minnesota--Neural Networks, Computer--Young Adult--all cause mortality--Article--atrial fibrillation--big data--Brazil--cardiologist--cardiovascular mortality--deep neural network--ECG abnormality--electrocardiography--emergency physician--human--machine learning--medical student--predictive value--priority journal--prognosis--sensitivity and specificity--sex difference--telehealth--adolescent--atrial fibrillation--female--Minnesota--young adult;Churchill Livingstone Inc.;31526573;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85072083527

Therefore, early, automated, efficient and accurate determination of this fatal disease can save thousands of lives throughout the world. Efficient incorporation of data mining and machine learning techniques can contribute a lot to reduce negative impact of this disease. Realizing the worth of this situation, this paper proposes an automated approach by incorporating machine learning and data mining techniques for classification as well as illustration of the relationships between the key parameters of this disease. For classification purpose, Convolutional Neural Network architecture has been optimized using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) by replacing back propagation. Moreover, for conducting comparison between CNN optimized with ACO and other well know existing approaches--Support vector machine, multilayer perceptron, random forest and additive regression have also been implemented. Additionally, for rule generation, filtered association and J48 approaches have been implemented and applied on the dataset.

In our previous work, we built computational models to predict one-year mortality of patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with AMI or post myocardial infarction syndrome. Our prior work only used the structured clinical data from MIMIC-III, a publicly available ICU clinical database. In this study, we enhanced our work by adding the word embedding features from free-text discharge summaries. Using a richer set of features resulted in significant improvement in the performance of our deep learning models. The average accuracy of our deep learning models was 92.89% and the average F-measure was 0.928.

This method is based on deep neural networks with pretraining and takes as an input a raw ECG signal without annotation. This work is based on a prospective clinical study that took place at Hospital Clínic in Barcelona between 2011–2012 and recruited 1390 patients. For each patient, we recorded a 12-lead ECG and the diagnosis was conducted by the cardiology service at the same hospital. Normal, borderline normal and normal variant ECGs were labelled as normal and the rest as abnormal. Our deep neural networks with pretraining were tested through cross-validation with a cohort of 416 test patients. The performance of our model was compared against other standard classification methods such as neural networks without pretraining, Support Vector Machines, Extreme Learning Machines, k-Nearest Neighbours and a professional classification algorithm certified for medical use that annotates the raw ECG signals prior to classification. The resulting best classifier was a pretrained neural network with three hidden layers and 700 units in every layer. This network yielded an accuracy of 0.8552, a sensitivity of 0.9176 and a specificity of 0.7827. The best alternative classification method was a Support Vector Machine with a Gaussian kernel, which yielded an accuracy of 0.8476, a sensitivity of 0.9446 and a specificity of 0.7346. The professional classification algorithm yielded an accuracy of 0.8407, a sensitivity of 0.8558 and a specificity of 0.8214. Neural networks with pretraining automatically obtain a representation of the input data without resorting to any annotation and, thus, simplify the process of assessing normality of ECG signals. The results that we have obtained are slightly better than those obtained with the professional classification system and, for some network configurations, they can be considered as exchangeable. Neural networks with pretraining open up a promising line of research for the automatic assessment of ECG signals that may be used in the future in clinical practice. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.;Cardiology--Deep learning--Electrocardiography--Neural networks--Pretraining--Restricted Boltzmann machines;Cardiology--Diagnosis--Electrocardiography--Hospitals--Learning systems--Nearest neighbor search--Neural networks--Professional aspects--Support vector machines--Classification algorithm--Classification methods--Classification system--Deep learning--Extreme learning machine--Network configuration--Pre-training--Restricted boltzmann machine--Biomedical signal processing;Elsevier Ltd;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-84984991409

A promising alternative is to fine-tune a CNN that has been pre-trained using, for instance, a large set of labeled natural images. However, the substantial differences between natural and medical images may advise against such knowledge transfer. In this paper, we seek to answer the following central question in the context of medical image analysis: Can the use of pre-trained deep CNNs with sufficient fine-tuning eliminate the need for training a deep CNN from scratch? To address this question, we considered four distinct medical imaging applications in three specialties (radiology, cardiology, and gastroenterology) involving classification, detection, and segmentation from three different imaging modalities, and investigated how the performance of deep CNNs trained from scratch compared with the pre-trained CNNs fine-tuned in a layer-wise manner. Our experiments consistently demonstrated that 1) the use of a pre-trained CNN with adequate fine-tuning outperformed or, in the worst case, performed as well as a CNN trained from scratch--2) fine-tuned CNNs were more robust to the size of training sets than CNNs trained from scratch--3) neither shallow tuning nor deep tuning was the optimal choice for a particular application--and 4) our layer-wise fine-tuning scheme could offer a practical way to reach the best performance for the application at hand based on the amount of available data. © 1982-2012 IEEE.;Carotid intima-media thickness--computer-aided detection--convolutional neural networks--deep learning--fine-tuning--medical image analysis--polyp detection--pulmonary embolism detection--video quality assessment;Colonic Polyps--Colonoscopy--Computed Tomography Angiography--Diagnostic Imaging--Humans--Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted--Machine Learning--Neural Networks (Computer)--Pulmonary Embolism--ROC Curve--Computer aided analysis--Computer aided instruction--Convolution--Image analysis--Image segmentation--Knowledge management--Neural networks--Quality control--Carotid intima-media thickness--Computer aided detection--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Fine tuning--Polyp detection--Pulmonary embolism--Video quality assessment--arterial wall thickness--Article--artificial neural network--colon polyp--colonoscopy--computer assisted tomography--convolutional neural network--convolutional neural network trained from scratch--diagnostic imaging--echography--human--image analysis--image quality--lung angiography--lung embolism--pre trained convolutional neural network fined tuned--quality control--colon polyp--computed tomographic angiography--computer assisted diagnosis--lung embolism--machine learning--receiver operating characteristic--Medical imaging;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;26978662;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-84968649810

Manual evaluation of these time-series, however, is expensive and prone to biased and non-reproducible outcomes. In this paper, we present a method that addresses named limitations by integrating segmentation and disease classification into a fully automatic processing pipeline. We use an ensemble of UNet inspired architectures for segmentation of cardiac structures such as the left and right ventricular cavity (LVC, RVC) and the left ventricular myocardium (LVM) on each time instance of the cardiac cycle. For the classification task, information is extracted from the segmented time-series in form of comprehensive features handcrafted to reflect diagnostic clinical procedures. Based on these features we train an ensemble of heavily regularized multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and a random forest classifier to predict the pathologic target class. We evaluated our method on the ACDC dataset (4 pathology groups, 1 healthy group) and achieve dice scores of 0.945 (LVC), 0.908 (RVC) and 0.905 (LVM) in a cross-validation over the training set (100 cases) and 0.950 (LVC), 0.923 (RVC) and 0.911 (LVM) on the test set (50 cases). We report a classification accuracy of 94 % on a training set cross-validation and 92 % on the test set.

ACS diagnosis poses a highly complex problem where the use of intelligent systems represents an opportunity for the optimization of the diagnosis. The objective of the present work is to perform a cross validation of a federation of collaborative rational agents for the diagnosis of ACS in a population with high probability exhibiting chest pain. A study of diagnostic tests was performed, the diagnostic standard criterion was the third redefinition of infarction or some strategy for coronary stratification. The index test was the result of a system based on a federation of collaborative rational agents based on the assembly of neural networks by means of a weighted voting system in accordance with positive likelihood ratios. A sample of 108 patients was calculated and a contingency table was built in order to calculate the operational characteristics. 148 patients were taken into consideration, ACS was discarded in 29,2%, 51,7 exhibited acute infarction, and 19,1% exhibited unstable angina. The federation system reached a precision of 79%, sensibility of 97,1%, specificity of 36,4%, and AUC of 0,672. It is concluded that a multi-agent system based on the assembly of neural networks attained an acceptable performance for the diagnosis of ACS in a population with high probability. © 2016 IEEE.;Acute coronary syndrome--Acute myocardial infarction--Artificial neural networks--Assembly-based systems--Chest pain--Intelligent systems--Medical diagnosis--Multi-agent systems--Unstable angina;Artificial intelligence--Cardiology--Deep neural networks--Diagnosis--Heart--Intelligent agents--Intelligent systems--Learning systems--Neural networks--Probability--Voting machines--Acceptable performance--Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)--Acute coronary syndromes--Acute myocardial infarction--Chest pain--Operational characteristics--Unstable angina--Weighted voting systems--Multi agent systems;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85015404999

In this paper, we explore the application of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for automatic detection of atrial fibrillation (AF). The 2-dimension parameter input structure is essential for DCNNs and tens of thousands of samples are also needed for the proper operation. As we know, ECG is one-dimension time-varying signal, which doesn't match the requirement for the input structure of DCNNs. Furthermore the number of the marked AF samples is also limited. To address these problems, we adopt the stationary wavelet transform (SWT) for ECG preprocessing and then the processed signal is reorganized into two-dimensional parameter structure to meet the requirement of input structure of DCNNs. Besides, the original ECG signals are divided into very short data segments (namely 5-second segments) for the following reasons. On the one hand, short ECG segment is helpful for the algorithm assessment of short AF episode detection. On the other hand, it can also increase the number of AF sample for machine learning and experiment evaluation. As for DCNNs, multiple convolutional layers and fully connected layers are used for deep learning. On the MIT-BIH Atrial fibrillation data set, the proposed method can achieve sensitivity of 98.79%, specificity of 97.87% and accuracy of 98.63%, which outperforms most of other algorithms. © 2017 IEEE Computer Society.

AI techniques have been applied in cardiovascular medicine to explore novel genotypes and phenotypes in existing diseases, improve the quality of patient care, enable cost-effectiveness, and reduce readmission and mortality rates. Over the past decade, several machine-learning techniques have been used for cardiovascular disease diagnosis and prediction. Each problem requires some degree of understanding of the problem, in terms of cardiovascular medicine and statistics, to apply the optimal machine-learning algorithm. In the near future, AI will result in a paradigm shift toward precision cardiovascular medicine. The potential of AI in cardiovascular medicine is tremendous--however, ignorance of the challenges may overshadow its potential clinical impact.

However, feature extraction is one of the challenges in MI classification as the extracted features may not be optimized for class separation. To this end, we propose a new deep feature learning based MI detection and classification approach. It seeks to learn a representation of the extracted features that optimize the classification performance. Moreover, to further enhance the feature learning process, we incorporate multi-scale discrete wavelet transformation into the feature learning process to facilitate the extraction of MI features at specific frequency resolutions/scales. Finally, softmax regression is employed to build a multi-class classifier based on the learned optimal representation of the features. Experimental results using public ECG datasets obtained from the PTB diagnostic database show that the proposed approach can achieve better performance than other state-of-The-Art approaches in terms of sensitivity and specificity. The effectiveness and good performance of the proposed approach may serve as an attractive alternative to MI classification or other related applications. © 2016 IEEE.;Deep Feature Learning--Myocardial Infarction Detection and Classification;Cardiology--Deep learning--Diagnosis--Digital signal processing--Discrete wavelet transforms--Extraction--Feature extraction--Machine learning--Classification algorithm--Classification approach--Classification performance--Deep feature learning--Discrete wavelet transformation--Myocardial Infarction--Sensitivity and specificity--State-of-the-art approach--Classification (of information);Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85016178439

Existing methods of abnormality detection are specific to the disease and usually involve extraction of various anatomical structures seen in an echocardiogram and hence, are dependent on accurate segmentation methods. In this paper, we propose a novel method of determining abnormalities from echocardiograms by directly regressing for key measurements using suitable deep learning networks. This method is illustrated in the automatic discrimination of normal and dilated cardiomyopathy cases. Specifically, a network is trained on the association of specific echocardiogram views with clinical measurements taken from such views. We show the superiority of this method of assessing abnormality by comparing it to the conventional region extraction and region characterization methods. © 2018 IEEE.;Heart--Machine learning--Quantification--Ultrasound;Cardiology--Echocardiography--Extraction--Heart--Learning systems--Medical imaging--Ultrasonics--Abnormality detection--Anatomical structures--Cardio-vascular disease--Characterization methods--Clinical measurements--Dilated cardiomyopathy--Quantification--Segmentation methods--Deep learning;IEEE Computer Society;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85048097175

Science, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, United States;To date, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of global death. The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most widely adopted clinical tool that measures the electrical activities of the heart from the body surface. However, heart rhythm irregularities cannot always be detected on a standard resting ECG machine, since they may not occur during an individual's recording session. Common Holter-based portable solutions that record ECG for up to 24 to 48 hours lack the capability to provide real-time feedback. In this research, we seek to establish a cell phone-based real-time monitoring technology for CVD, capable of performing continuous on-line ECG processing, generating a personalized cardiac health summary report in layman's language, automatically detecting and classifying abnormal CVD conditions, all in real time. Specifically, we developed an adaptive artificial neural network (ANN)-based machine learning technique, combining both an individual's cardiac characteristics and information from clinical ECG databases, to train the cell phone to learn to adapt to its user's physiological conditions to achieve better ECG feature extraction and more accurate CVD classification on cell phones. ©2009 IEEE.;;Artificial intelligence--Cardiology--Cellular telephones--Classification (of information)--Deep neural networks--Diseases--Electrocardiography--Feature extraction--Heart--Learning systems--mHealth--Mobile phones--Neural networks--Telecommunication equipment--Telephone sets--Adaptive artificial neural networks--Adaptive machine learning--Cardiovascular disease--ECG Feature extractions--Electrical activities--Machine learning techniques--Physiological condition--Real time monitoring--Cellular telephone systems;IEEE Computer Society;19964449;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-77951017492

On histology, both are characterized by an expansion of the cellular and acellular stromal tissue as well as morphologic changes within myocytes, among other features. There is growing evidence, from a number of diseases, that computer-extracted features of tissue and nuclear architecture are not only useful for diagnostics, but can also predict disease recurrence, progression, and patient outcome. Automated tools to segment myocytes and stroma with high fidelity are a critical first step toward developing predictive models to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and reproducibility in cardiac pathology. Whole-slide imaging in digital pathology is producing large, rich data sets for machine learning algorithms that learn features representations directly from data, such as deep neural networks or ""deep learning"". Deep learning has achieved state of the art performance in computer vision and is becoming ubiquitous within the realm of digital pathology. Here, we present a deep learning framework for myocyte and stroma segmentation in H&E stained cardiac biopsies using a data set of 103 patients with clinical heart failure or non-heart failure controls. We provide a tutorial for how to use the AlexNet architecture, implemented in Caffe, to train a pixel-level classifier for segmentation. We compare the performance of our deep learning approach to a random forest classifier with 333 intensity and texture features and test on 20 held-out patient images with expert ground-truth annotation of tissue boundaries. We find our deep learning segmentation outperforms random forests in terms of mean (a) AUC (0.95 vs 0.80), (b) F-score (0.96 vs 0.91), (c) TPR (0.96 vs 0.92), (d) TNR (0.94 vs 0.67), and (e) modified Hausdorff distance on the segmentation perimeter pixels (51 vs 122). © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The main objective is to investigate whether reliable S1 and S2 recognition performance can still be attained under situations where the duration and interval information might not be accessible. Methods: A deep neural network (DNN) method is proposed for recognizing S1 and S2 heart sounds. In the proposed method, heart sound signals are first converted into a sequence of Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). The K-means algorithm is applied to cluster MFCC features into two groups to refine their representation and discriminative capability. The refined features are then fed to a DNN classifier to perform S1 and S2 recognition. We conducted experiments using actual heart sound signals recorded using an electronic stethoscope. Precision, recall, F-measure, and accuracy are used as the evaluation metrics. Results: The proposed DNN-based method can achieve high precision, recall, and F-measure scores with more than 91% accuracy rate. Conclusion: The DNN classifier provides higher evaluation scores compared with other well-known pattern classification methods. Significance: The proposed DNN-based method can achieve reliable S1 and S2 recognition performance based on acoustic characteristics without using an ECG reference or incorporating the assumptions of the individual durations of S1 and S2 and time intervals of S1-S2 and S2-S1. © 2016 IEEE.;Acoustic fingerprinting--Deep neural networks--Heart sound recognition--S1 and S2 recognition;Female--Heart Auscultation--Heart Sounds--Humans--Male--Neural Networks (Computer)--Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted--Stethoscopes--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Deep neural networks--Heart--Speech recognition--Acoustic characteristic--Electronic stethoscope--Evaluation metrics--Heart sound signal--Heart sounds--Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients--Recognition process--S1 and S2 recognition--Article--audio recording--classification algorithm--comparative effectiveness--deep neural network--electronic stethoscope--evaluation study--experimental study--heart auscultation--heart sound--k means algorithm--machine learning--measurement accuracy--measurement precision--pattern recognition--phonocardiography--recall--signal detection--waveform--artificial neural network--classification--female--heart sound--human--male--physiology--procedures--signal processing--stethoscope--Biomedical signal processing;IEEE Computer Society;28113191;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85014528471

For critical hospitalized patients, we introduce a deep learning framework for hospital records that uses a Word2Vec vector space representation to learn from a combination of structured data and unstructured text. The deep learning framework is able to assess patient risk, and accurately predict medical outcomes into the future. For less critical patients living at home, we also present algorithms for remote monitoring that can track a patient's changing health indicators using a wearable heart-rate sensors. The pool of individuals living with congestive heart failure is very diverse, which can make multifaceted approaches to health monitoring, such as those presented in this work, attractive for observing large pools of high-risk patients.

In this regard, we investigate the efficacy of using the pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) from large-scale image data for the classification of Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals by learning deep PCG representations. First, the PCG files are segmented into chunks of equal length. Then, we extract a scalogram image from each chunk using a wavelet transformation. Next, the scalogram images are fed into either a pre-trained CNN, or the same network fine-tuned on heart sound data. Deep representations are then extracted from a fully connected layer of each network and classification is achieved by a static classifier. Alternatively, the scalogram images are fed into an end-to-end CNN formed by adapting a pre-trained network via transfer learning. Key results indicate that our deep PCG representations extracted from a fine-tuned CNN perform the strongest, 56.2 % mean accuracy, on our heart sound classification task. When compared to a baseline accuracy of 46.9 %, gained using conventional audio processing features and a support vector machine, this is a significant relative improvement of 19.8 % (p < .001 by one-tailed z-test). © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.;Convolutional neural networks--Heart sound classification--Phonocardiogram--Scalogram--Transfer learning;Cardiology--Convolution--Heart--Image classification--Learning systems--Network layers--Neural networks--Phonocardiography--Convolutional neural network--Heart sounds--Phonocardiograms--Scalogram--Transfer learning--Image compression;Association for Computing Machinery;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85047210220

Clinicians providing congenital cardiac care may benefit from collaborative learning given the complexity of the patient population and team approach to patient care. Rationale and development Industrial system engineers first performed broad-based time-motion and process analyses of congenital cardiac care programs at 5 Pediatric Heart Network core centers. Rotating multidisciplinary team site visits to each center were completed to facilitate deep learning and information exchange. Through monthly conference calls and an in-person meeting, we determined that duration of mechanical ventilation following infant cardiac surgery was one key variation that could impact a number of clinical outcomes. This was underscored by one participating center's practice of early extubation in the majority of its patients. A consensus clinical practice guideline using collaborative learning was developed and implemented by multidisciplinary teams from the same 5 centers. The 1-year prospective initiative was completed in May 2015, and data analysis is under way. Conclusion Collaborative learning that uses multidisciplinary team site visits and information sharing allows for rapid structured fact-finding and dissemination of expertise among institutions. System modeling and machine learning approaches objectively identify and prioritize focused areas for guideline development. The collaborative learning framework can potentially be applied to other components of congenital cardiac care and provide a complement to randomized clinical trials as a method to rapidly inform and improve the care of children with congenital heart disease. © 2016 Mosby, Inc.

Existing practical solutions for cardiovascular risk detection are mostly hybrid systems entailing the integration of knowledge-driven and data-driven methods, relying on dictionaries, rules and machine learning methods that require a substantial amount of human effort. This paper proposes a comparative analysis on the applicability of deep learning, a re-emerged data-driven technique, in the context of clinical text classification. Various deep learning architectures were devised and evaluated for extracting heart disease risk factors from clinical documents. The data provided for the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth shared task focusing on identifying risk factors for heart disease was used for system development and evaluation. Results have shown that a relatively simple deep learning model can achieve a high micro-averaged F-measure of 0.9081, which is comparable to the best systems from the shared task. This is highly encouraging given the simplicity of the deep learning approach compared to the heavily feature-engineered hybrid approaches that were required to achieve state-of-the-art performances. ©2018 Association for Computational Linguistics;;Automation--Cardiology--Classification (of information)--Computer aided diagnosis--Deep learning--Diseases--Heart--Medical computing--Risk assessment--Text processing--Cardiovascular risk--Clinical decision--Disease progression modelling--Disease risks--Heart disease--Integration of knowledge--Learning approach--Practical solutions--Risk detections--Risk factors--Hybrid systems;Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL);;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85080984245

This study presents an intelligence-based, novel, robust, and clinically-strong strategy that uses a combination of deep-learning (DL) and machine-learning (ML) paradigms. Methodology: A two-stage DL-based system (a class of AtheroEdge™ systems) was proposed for cIMT measurements. Stage I consisted of a convolution layer-based encoder for feature extraction and a fully convolutional network-based decoder for image segmentation. This stage generated the raw inner lumen borders and raw outer interadventitial borders. To smooth these borders, the DL system used a cascaded stage II that consisted of ML-based regression. The final outputs were the far wall lumen-intima (LI) and media-adventitia (MA) borders which were used for cIMT measurements. There were two sets of gold standards during the DL design, therefore two sets of DL systems (DL1 and DL2) were derived. Results: A total of 396 B-mode ultrasound images of the right and left common carotid artery were used from 203 patients (Institutional Review Board approved, Toho University, Japan). For the test set, the cIMT error for the DL1 and DL2 systems with respect to the gold standard was 0.126 ± 0.134 and 0.124 ± 0.100 mm, respectively. The corresponding LI error for the DL1 and DL2 systems was 0.077 ± 0.057 and 0.077 ± 0.049 mm, respectively, while the corresponding MA error for DL1 and DL2 was 0.113 ± 0.105 and 0.109 ± 0.088 mm, respectively. The results showed up to 20% improvement in cIMT readings for the DL system compared to the sonographer's readings. Four statistical tests were conducted to evaluate reliability, stability, and statistical significance. Conclusion: The results showed that the performance of the DL-based approach was superior to the nonintelligence-based conventional methods that use spatial intensities alone. The DL system can be used for stroke risk assessment during routine or clinical trial modes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;Accurate--Cardiovascular diseases--Carotid intima-media thickness--Deep learning--Intelligence--Machine learning--Reproducible--Segmentation--Stroke--Ultrasound scans;Aged--Aged, 80 and over--Carotid Arteries--Carotid Artery Diseases--Carotid Intima-Media Thickness--Cohort Studies--Databases, Factual--Deep Learning--Diabetes Complications--Female--Humans--Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted--Japan--Male--ROC Curve--Ultrasonography--Artificial intelligence--Cardiology--Convolution--Diseases--Errors--Image segmentation--Learning systems--Risk assessment--Thickness measurement--Ultrasonics--cholesterol--high density lipoprotein cholesterol--low density lipoprotein cholesterol--Accurate--Cardio-vascular disease--Carotid intima-media thickness--Intelligence--Reproducible--Stroke--Ultrasound scans--aged--area under the curve--arterial wall thickness--Article--benchmarking--carotid artery--cholesterol blood level--cholesterol level--clinical evaluation--cohort analysis--comparative study--deep learning--diabetes mellitus--diagnostic test accuracy study--feature extraction--female--gold standard--high risk patient--human--image segmentation--information processing--Japanese (people)--left common carotid artery--lumen intima--machine learning--major clinical study--male--measurement error--media adventitia--null hypothesis--priority journal--receiver operating characteristic--right common carotid artery--smoking--ultrasound--carotid artery disease--computer assisted diagnosis--diabetic complication--diagnostic imaging--echography--factual database--Japan--procedures--very elderly--Deep learning;Elsevier Ltd;29778925;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85047207454

Mickiewicza 30, Kraków, 30-059, Poland;The analysis of phonocardiogram (PCG), although considered as well established in a clinical application, still constitutes the valuable source of diagnostic data. Currently, electronic auscultation provides digital signals which can be processed in order to automatically evaluate the condition of heart or lungs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the classification of phonocardiographic signals. We extracted a set of time-frequency parameters which enable to effectively differentiate between normal and abnormal heart beats (with valve defects). These features have constituted an input of the convolutional neural network, which we used for classification of pathological signals. The Aalborg University heart sounds database from PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2016 was used for verification of developed algorithms. We obtained 99.1% sensitivity and 91.6% specificity on the test data, which is motivational for further research. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.;Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Heart sound classification--Machine learning--Signal processing;;Springer Verlag;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85029539207

The Michigan heart sound and murmur database (MHSDB) provided by the University of Michigan Health System was used in this research. The heart sounds are segmented per heartbeat and each segment is converted to form an intensity map and classified using two methods: a simple Softmax Regression (SMR) network and a convolutional neural network (CNN). This approach removes the need to provide features for supervised machine learning methods. Instead, the features are determined automatically through training of the neural network models. The result proves that the CNN is able to provide much better classification accuracy than the Softmax Regression network. In addition, classification of periodic heart sounds provides better resolution in detecting abnormal heart sounds in early stage of heart disease. Due to its simplicity in implementation, this approach can be used for real-time classification of heart sounds in wearable devices and smartphones in settings beyond hospitals. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.;Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Heart sound classification--Softmax regression;Convolution--Deep learning--Heart--Neural networks--Regression analysis--Supervised learning--Classification accuracy--Classification of heart sounds--Convolutional neural network--Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)--Heart sounds--Learning neural networks--Softmax regressions--Supervised machine learning--Cardiology;Association for Computing Machinery;;Conference paper;Scopus;2-s2.0-85051418930

It proved that human heart becomes more spherical and loses muscle mass in space due to reduced heart activity. This was corroborated by another study in 2016, which researched long-term health of Apollo astronauts and found that deep-space astronauts are five times more likely to succumb to heart diseases due to radiations in space. Current methods for diagnosing Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) include minimally invasive methods such as: functional imaging of coronary arteries using computed tomography, cardiac positron emission tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to assess alterations in myocardial and coronary blood flow--stress echocardiography to measure strength and timing of electrical signals as blood flows through the coronary vessels and different parts of the heart--and, electrocardiogram (EKG) to record strength of electric signals as they pass through coronary arteries. Invasive diagnosis methods include: blood tests and measurement of blood count parameters to monitor the change in inflammatory markers over time--and, coronary angiography to find blockages in the coronary arteries. Amongst these, two techniques of relevance for prediction of CAD in astronauts are EKG readouts and quantitative measurements from the different imaging modalities. EKG measurements are significant as continuous measurements can be easily obtained by having an EKG measuring device strapped onto astronauts always. Results from different functional imaging methods can be reconstructed into three dimensional images to predict coronary vessel structure and perfusion within the vessel wall. We propose that by integrating the information obtained from the methods described above, along with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, new methods and systems can be developed to continuously monitor the heart condition of astronauts. With an increased use of wearable devices, monitoring the heart condition is not very difficult today. However, there are major differences between the physiology of humans on earth and astronauts in space, as astronauts react differently when subjected to zero-gravity and space radiations. We propose AI techniques, including machine learning methods, and architecture of sensors to enable predictive and contextual analysis of astronauts' heart conditions.

Our aim was to identify distinct HCM phenotypes based on ECG computational analysis, and characterize differences in clinical risk factors and anatomical differences using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Methods: High-fidelity 12-lead Holter ECGs from 85 HCM patients and 38 healthy volunteers were analyzed using mathematical modeling and computational clustering to identify phenotypic subgroups. Clinical features and the extent and distribution of hypertrophy assessed by CMR were evaluated in the subgroups. Results: QRS morphology alone was crucial to identify three HCM phenotypes with very distinct QRS patterns. Group 1 (n = 44) showed normal QRS morphology, Group 2 (n = 19) showed short R and deep S waves in V4, and Group 3 (n = 22) exhibited short R and long S waves in V4-6, and left QRS axis deviation. However, no differences in arrhythmic risk or distribution of hypertrophy were observed between these groups. Including T wave biomarkers in the clustering, four HCM phenotypes were identified: Group 1A (n = 20), with primary repolarization abnormalities showing normal QRS yet inverted T waves, Group 1B (n = 24), with normal QRS morphology and upright T waves, and Group 2 and Group 3 remaining as before, with upright T waves. Group 1A patients, with normal QRS and inverted T wave, showed increased HCM Risk-SCD scores (1A: 4.0%, 1B: 1.8%, 2: 2.1%, 3: 2.5%, p = 0.0001), and a predominance of coexisting septal and apical hypertrophy (p < 0.0001). HCM patients in Groups 2 and 3 exhibited predominantly septal hypertrophy (85 and 90%, respectively). Conclusion: HCM patients were classified in four subgroups with distinct ECG features. Patients with primary T wave inversion not secondary to QRS abnormalities had increased HCM Risk-SCD scores and coexisting septal and apical hypertrophy, suggesting that primary T wave inversion may increase SCD risk in HCM, rather than T wave inversion secondary to depolarization abnormalities. Computational ECG phenotyping provides insight into the underlying processes captured by the ECG and has the potential to be a novel and independent factor for risk stratification. © 2018 Lyon, Ariga, Mincholé, Mahmod, Ormondroyd, Laguna, de Freitas, Neubauer, Watkins and Rodriguez.;Computational clustering--E-cardiology--Electrocardiography--Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy--Phenotyping;adult--Article--asymptomatic disease--cardiovascular magnetic resonance--clinical feature--cohort analysis--controlled study--disease classification--female--follow up--Holter monitoring--human--hypertrophic cardiomyopathy--machine learning--major clinical study--male--mathematical model--middle aged--prospective study--QRS amplitude--QRS interval--R wave--risk factor--S wave amplitude--sudden cardiac death--T wave amplitude--T wave inversion;Frontiers Media S.A.;;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85043516149

Our primary classification framework constitutes a convolutional neural network with 1D-CNN time-convolution (tConv) layers, which uses features transferred from a model trained on the 2016 Physionet Heart Sound Database. We also employ a Representation Learning (RL) approach to generate features in an unsupervised manner using Deep Recurrent Autoencoders and use Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifiers. Finally, we utilize an SVM classifier on a high-dimensional segment-level feature extracted using various functionals on short-term acoustic features, i.e., Low-Level Descriptors (LLD).

These include a family of operations encompassing several terms like machine learning, cognitive learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning-based methods that can be used to integrate and interpret complex biomedical and healthcare data in scenarios where traditional statistical methods may not be able to perform. In this review article, we discuss the basics of machine learning algorithms and what potential data sources exist--evaluate the need for machine learning--and examine the potential limitations and challenges of implementing machine in the context of cardiovascular medicine. The most promising avenues for AI in medicine are the development of automated risk prediction algorithms which can be used to guide clinical care--use of unsupervised learning techniques to more precisely phenotype complex disease--and the implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms to intelligently augment healthcare providers. The utility of a machine learning-based predictive model will depend on factors including data heterogeneity, data depth, data breadth, nature of modelling task, choice of machine learning and feature selection algorithms, and orthogonal evidence. A critical understanding of the strength and limitations of various methods and tasks amenable to machine learning is vital. By leveraging the growing corpus of big data in medicine, we detail pathways by which machine learning may facilitate optimal development of patientspecific models for improving diagnoses, intervention and outcome in cardiovascular medicine. © 2018 BMJ Publishing Group.

We propose and demonstrate a deep learning approach for fetal QRS complex detection from raw NI-FECG signals by using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The main objective is to investigate whether reliable fetal QRS complex detection performance can still be obtained from features of single-channel NI-FECG signals, without canceling maternal ECG (MECG) signals. Approach: A deep learning method is proposed for recognizing fetal QRS complexes. Firstly, we collect data from set-a of the PhysioNet/computing in Cardiology Challenge database. The sample entropy method is used for signal quality assessment. Part of the bad quality signals is excluded in the further analysis. Secondly, in the proposed method, the features of raw NI-FECG signals are normalized before they are fed to a CNN classifier to perform fetal QRS complex detection. We use precision, recall, F-measure and accuracy as the evaluation metrics to assess the performance of fetal QRS complex detection. Main results: The proposed deep learning method can achieve relatively high precision (75.33%), recall (80.54%), and F-measure scores (77.85%) compared with three other well-known pattern classification methods, namely KNN, naive Bayes and SVM. Significance: The proposed deep learning method can attain reliable fetal QRS complex detection performance from the raw NI-FECG signals without canceling MECG signals. In addition, the influence of different activation functions and signal quality assessment on classification performance are evaluated, and results show that Relu outperforms the Sigmoid and Tanh on this particular task, and better classification performance is obtained with the signal quality assessment step in this study. © 2018 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.;convolutional neural network--deep learning--fetal QRS complexes--Non-invasive foetal ECG--signal quality assessment;Deep Learning--Electrocardiography--Fetus--Humans--Neural Networks (Computer)--Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted--Biomedical signal processing--Convolution--Deep neural networks--Electrocardiography--Feature extraction--Quality control--Signal detection--Support vector machines--Convolutional neural network--Deep learning--Fetal ECG--Fetal electrocardiographies--Fetal QRS complex--Learning methods--Non-invasive fetal ECG--QRS complex detection--QRS complexes--Signal quality assessment--artificial neural network--electrocardiography--fetus--human--physiology--signal processing--Complex networks;IOP Publishing Ltd;29485406;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85047365215

To classify the medical subdomain of a note accurately, we have constructed a machine learning-based natural language processing (NLP) pipeline and developed medical subdomain classifiers based on the content of the note. Methods: We constructed the pipeline using the clinical NLP system, clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES), the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus, Semantic Network, and learning algorithms to extract features from two datasets - clinical notes from Integrating Data for Analysis, Anonymization, and Sharing (iDASH) data repository (n = 431) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) (n = 91,237), and built medical subdomain classifiers with different combinations of data representation methods and supervised learning algorithms. We evaluated the performance of classifiers and their portability across the two datasets. Results: The convolutional recurrent neural network with neural word embeddings trained-medical subdomain classifier yielded the best performance measurement on iDASH and MGH datasets with area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.975 and 0.991, and F1 scores of 0.845 and 0.870, respectively. Considering better clinical interpretability, linear support vector machine-trained medical subdomain classifier using hybrid bag-of-words and clinically relevant UMLS concepts as the feature representation, with term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf)-weighting, outperformed other shallow learning classifiers on iDASH and MGH datasets with AUC of 0.957 and 0.964, and F1 scores of 0.932 and 0.934 respectively. We trained classifiers on one dataset, applied to the other dataset and yielded the threshold of F1 score of 0.7 in classifiers for half of the medical subdomains we studied. Conclusion: Our study shows that a supervised learning-based NLP approach is useful to develop medical subdomain classifiers. The deep learning algorithm with distributed word representation yields better performance yet shallow learning algorithms with the word and concept representation achieves comparable performance with better clinical interpretability. Portable classifiers may also be used across datasets from different institutions. © 2017 The Author(s).;Deep Learning--Distributed Representation--Machine Learning--Medical Decision Making, Computer-assisted--Natural Language Processing--Unified Medical Language System;Clinical Decision-Making--Humans--Machine Learning--Medical Records--Natural Language Processing--Unified Medical Language System--anonymization--embedding--extraction--general hospital--human--learning algorithm--major clinical study--Massachusetts--medical decision making--natural language processing--nervous system--pipeline--receiver operating characteristic--support vector machine--Unified Medical Language System--clinical decision making--machine learning--medical record;BioMed Central Ltd;29191207;Article;Scopus;2-s2.0-85037036815

Although subjective visual interpretation remains the clinical mainstay, quantitative analysis facilitates objective, evidence-based management, and advances in clinical research. This has driven developments in computing and software tools aimed at achieving fully automated image processing and quantitative analysis. In parallel, machine learning techniques have been used to rapidly integrate large amounts of clinical and quantitative imaging data to provide highly personalized individual patient-based conclusions. Areas covered: This review summarizes recent advances in automated quantitative imaging in cardiology and describes the latest techniques which incorporate machine learning principles. The review focuses on the cardiac imaging techniques which are in wide clinical use. It also discusses key issues and obstacles for these tools to become utilized in mainstream clinical practice. Expert commentary: Fully-automated processing and high-level computer interpretation of cardiac imaging are becoming a reality. Application of machine learning to the vast amounts of quantitative data generated per scan and integration with clinical data also facilitates a move to more patient-specific interpretation. These developments are unlikely to replace interpreting physicians but will provide them with highly accurate tools to detect disease, risk-stratify, and optimize patient-specific treatment. However, with each technological advance, we move further from human dependence and closer to fully-automated machine interpretation. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;Artificial intelligence--cardiac imaging--deep learning--image segmentation--machine learning;Diagnostic Imaging--Heart--Humans--Image Processing, Computer-Assisted--Precision Medicine--Software--Artificial intelligence--Automation--Cardiology--Deep learning--Diseases--Heart--Image segmentation--Imaging techniques--Learning systems--Patient treatment--contrast medium--gadolinium--Cardiac imaging--Cardio-vascular disease--Evidence-based managements--Machine learning techniques--Non-invasive imaging--Quantitative imaging--Technological advances--Visual interpretation--automation--cardiac imaging--cardiology--cardiovascular magnetic resonance--clinical practice--computed tomographic angiography--computer--computer analysis--contrast echocardiography--contrast enhancement--coronary angiography--coronary artery atherosclerosis--coronary artery blood flow--coronary artery disease--coronary artery obstruction--diagnostic accuracy--diagnostic test accuracy study--digital imaging and communications in medicine--echocardiography--electronic patient record--external validity--heart infarction--heart muscle perfusion--heart muscle revascularization--human--image analysis--image processing--image segmentation--ischemic heart disease--machine learning--medical technology--outcome assessment--physician--picture archiving and communication system--positron emission tomography--quantitative analysis--Review--sensitivity and specificity--single photon emission computed tomography--speckle tracking echocardiography--standardization--three dimensional echocardiography--tissue characterization--tissue Doppler imaging--transthoracic echocardiography--devices--diagnostic imaging--heart--image processing--personalized medicine--procedures--software--Image processing;Taylor and Francis Ltd;28277804;Review;Scopus;2-s2.0-85015190048
